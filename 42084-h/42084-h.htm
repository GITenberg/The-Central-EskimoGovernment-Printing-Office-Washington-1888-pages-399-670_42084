<div class = "mynote">
<p><a name = "start" id = "start">This text</a> uses characters that
require UTF-8 (Unicode) file encoding, including:</p>

<p class = "inset">
χ (Greek chi, see below)<br>
ā ē ī ō ū (long vowels)<br>
œ (“oe” ligature)<br>
⅔ (see List of Illustrations)</p>

<p>In the main text, all but <b>χ</b> are rare. Long-vowel marks are
used in Figure captions and in the Glossary; <b>œ</b> occurs only in
scientific terms.</p>

<p>If any of these characters do not display properly&mdash;in
particular, if a diacritic does not appear directly above its
letter&mdash;or if the apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph
appear as garbage, you may have an incompatible browser or unavailable
fonts. First, make sure that your browser’s “character set” or “file
encoding” is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You may also need to change the
default font.</p>

<p>Parenthetical question marks (?) are in the original.</p>

<p>Orthography is explained early in the article. Modern (ICI) forms
should be deducible from Boas’s spellings. These are based on
Kleinschmidt, but with <b>q</b> in place of <b>ĸ</b> (kra). Note that
long vowels are rarely marked, except in the Glossary and in figure
captions. Words are often written with nasalized finals:
<b>n</b>&nbsp;for <b>t</b> sometimes, <b>ng</b>&nbsp;for <b>k</b> almost
always, <b>irn</b> (only) for <b>iq</b>. Medial <b>q</b> is usually
written <b>χ</b> (chi), representing the fricative pronunciation:
“Eχaluin” and similar.</p>

<p>Missing punctuation in Figure captions and the Glossary has been
silently supplied. Other typographical errors are shown with <ins class
= "correction" title = "like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>.</p>

<p>The <a href = "#arts_music">music</a> section (pages 648-658)
includes sound files in midi format. Depending on your browser, they
will either play as-is or will need to be downloaded to your computer.
Some browsers will offer two “Music” links; use the one that works best
for you.</p>

<p>The following account of the Central Eskimo contains chiefly the
results of the author’s own observations and collections made during a
journey to Cumberland Sound and Davis Strait, supplemented by extracts
from the reports of other travelers. The geographical results of this
journey have been published in a separate volume.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> A&nbsp;few traditions which
were considered unsuitable for publication by the Bureau of Ethnology
may be found in the Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft für
Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, 1887. The linguistic
material collected during the journey will be published separately.</p>

<p>Owing to unfortunate circumstances, the larger portion of the
author’s collections could not be brought home, and it has therefore
been necessary, in preparing this paper, to make use of those made by
C.&nbsp;F. Hall, 1860&ndash;1862 and 1865&ndash;1869; W.&nbsp;Mintzer,
1873-’74, and L.&nbsp;Kumlien, 1877-’78. Through the kindness of
Professor Otis T. Mason, I&nbsp;was allowed to make ample use of the
collections of the National Museum and have attached its numbers to the
specimens figured. The author’s collection is deposited in the Museum
für Völkerkunde at Berlin. I&nbsp;am indebted to the American Museum of
Natural History; to Mr. Appleton Sturgis, of New York; to Captain John
O. Spicer, of Groton, Conn.; and to Mrs. Adams, of Washington, D.C., for
several figures drawn from specimens in their possession.</p>

<h4><a name = "intro_ortho" id = "intro_ortho">ORTHOGRAPHY.</a></h4>
<p>In the spelling of Eskimo words the author has adhered as closely as
possible to Kleinschmidt’s orthography, as he did not deem it proper to
introduce a linguistic alphabet after so much has been published in
another and almost sufficient one.</p>

<p>Accents and lengths have been marked where it seemed to be desirable.
In quotations Eskimo words are spelled according to this system where it
is possible to recognize their meaning and derivation. In other cases
the original spelling of the authors has been retained. The alphabet
used in this paper is as follows:</p>

<p>The Eskimo inhabit almost the whole extent of the coast of Arctic

live in the northeastern part of the continent and on the eastern
islands of the Arctic-American Archipelago. In Smith Sound they inhabit
the most northern countries visited by man and their remains are even
found at its northern outlet. The southern and western boundaries of
this district are the countries about Fort Churchill, the middle part of
Back River, and the coast west of Adelaide Peninsula. Along the whole
extent of this line they are the neighbors of Indian tribes, with whom
they are generally on very bad terms, a&nbsp;mutual distrust existing
between the two races.</p>

<p>The geography of the whole country is known only in outline, and a
great portion of it awaits its explorer. Following is a sketch of what
is known about it, so far as it is of importance to the ethnologist.</p>

<p>The vast basin of Hudson Bay separates two large portions of the
American continent: Labrador and the region of the large Arctic rivers.
The southern shore of the bay is inhabited by Indian tribes who
interrupt the communication between the Eskimo of both regions. Hudson
Bay, however, has the character of a true mediterranean sea, the
northern parts of its opposite shores being connected by a number of
islands and peninsulas. The low and narrow Rae Isthmus, which presents
an easy passage to the Arctic Ocean, unites Melville Peninsula to the
main body of the continent. From this peninsula Baffin Land stretches
out toward the north of Labrador, with only two narrow channels
intervening: Fury and Hecla Strait and Hudson Strait. Another chain of
islands, formed by the parts of Southampton Island and Mansfield Island,
stretches from Repulse Bay to the northwest point of Labrador, but the
distances between the islands and the roughness of the sea prevent
communication.</p>

<p>On the western part of the continent the great bays, Chesterfield
Inlet and Wager River, are of importance, as they allow the Eskimo,
though they are a coast people, to penetrate into the interior of the
continent. A&nbsp;narrow isthmus separates the head of the bays from the
lakes of Back River. At Coronation Bay the latter approaches the Arctic
Ocean very closely, and it is probable that the coast west of Adelaide
Peninsula, which is skirted by innumerable islands, is indented by deep
inlets extending towards the lakes of Back River. Thus communication
between the Arctic Ocean and Hudson Bay is facilitated by this large
river, which yields an abundant supply of fish. From Wager River an
isthmus leads to its estuary.</p>

<p>Boothia Felix, the most northern peninsula of the continent, is
united to it by two narrow isthmuses, the former extending from
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page415" id =
"page415">415</a></span>
Pelly Bay to Shepherd Bay, the latter from Lord Mayor Bay to Spence Bay.
It is separated from North Somerset by the narrow Bellot Strait. Farther
west Adelaide Peninsula and King William Land form the continuation of
the continent toward the western extremity of Boothia, thus outlining a
spacious bay sheltered from the currents and the pack ice of Melville
Sound and the adjoining bays. The eastern sides of Boothia and North
Somerset and the western coasts of Melville Peninsula and Baffin Land
form a gulf similar to Fox Basin.</p>

<p>Farther north, between Baffin Land and Greenland, North Devon and
Ellesmere Land are situated. Thus Baffin Land forms a connecting link
for three regions inhabited by Eskimo: the Hudson Bay Territory,
Labrador, and Greenland.</p>

<p>The orography of the western coast of Hudson Bay is little known.
Most of this coast seems to form a hilly land, consisting generally of
granite. Between Wager River and Chesterfield Inlet it rises to a chain
of hills of about one thousand feet in height, extending to a plateau
farther north. Another chain seems to stretch in a northeasterly
direction from Back River to the source of Hayes River. West of Back
River Silurian strata prevail. The granite hills form a favorite haunt
for the musk ox and reindeer.</p>

<p>Melville Peninsula consists chiefly of a chain of granite hills,
sloping down to a Silurian plain in the eastern part of the peninsula.
The northeastern part of Baffin Land is formed by a high chain of
mountains stretching from Lancaster Sound to Cape Mercy. Long fjords and
deep valleys divide them into many groups. Bylot Island, which stands
high out of the sea, is separated from the mainland by Pond Bay and
Eclipse Sound. The next group stretches from Pond Bay to the fjord of
Anaulereë´ling. Farther to the southeast the groups are smaller, and in
Home Bay they are separated by wide valleys, particularly near
Eχalualuin, a&nbsp;large fjord on the southern side of that bay.</p>

<p>From this fjord an enormous highland, which I named Penny Highland,
extends as far as Cumberland Sound, being terminated by the narrow
valley of Pangnirtung. The eastern boundary runs through the fjords
Maktartudjennaq and Narpaing to Nedluqseaq and Nudlung. In the interior
it may extend to about fifteen miles east of Issortuqdjuaq, the most
northern fjord of Cumberland Sound. The whole of the vast highland is
covered by an ice cap sending forth numerous glaciers in every
direction. In Pangnirtung and on Davis Strait they reach the level of
the sea.</p>

<p>Penny Highland, which forms the main body of Cumberland Peninsula,
has attached to it a few mountain groups of moderate extent: the
peninsula of Nudlung and the highland of Eχalualuin and that of
Qivitung.</p>

<p>Farther southeast, between the valleys of Pangnirtung and
Kingnait-Padli,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page416" id =
"page416">416</a></span>
is situated the highland of Kingnait, with sharp peaks emerging from the
ice cap which covers the lower parts of the plateau. The rest of
Cumberland Peninsula is formed by the highland of Saumia, which much
resembles that of Kingnait. Near Cape Mercy the ice covered highland
slopes down to a hilly region, which falls abruptly to the sea.</p>

<p>The southern parts of this range of mountains are composed of gneiss
and granite. It may be that Silurian strata occur in some places, but
they have not yet been found anywhere in situ. The northern parts are
too imperfectly known to enable us to form an idea of their geological
character.</p>

<p>The mountains just described slope down to a hilly region, which
farther to the west levels off to a plain. The hills are composed of
granite, the plains of Silurian limestone, which extends from Prince
Regent Inlet to the head of Frobisher Bay.</p>

<p>The peninsula between Cumberland Sound and Frobisher Bay is formed by
a plateau, which slopes down gradually to the northwest. It is drained
by a great river flowing into Auqardneling, a&nbsp;fjord on the western
shore of Cumberland Sound. Near Lake Nettilling the country is very low,
the level of the lake being only forty feet above that of the sea. Here
the watershed between Cumberland Sound and Fox Basin closely approaches
the eastern shore, coming within five miles of the head of Nettilling
Fjord. It is formed by a narrow neck of land about a quarter of a mile
wide and sixty-five feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>From Eskimo reports I conclude that the plateau of Nugumiut, as we
may call the peninsula between Frobisher Bay and Cumberland Sound, is
comparatively level. Only a single mountain south of Qasigidjen (Bear
Sound) rises into the region of eternal snow.</p>

<p>The peninsula between Frobisher Bay and Hudson Strait is formed by a
granite highland, the Meta Incognita of Queen Elizabeth. It is covered
with ice and sends a few glaciers into the sea. Farther west, near
Lesseps Bay and White Bear Sound, the country becomes lower. The narrow
isthmus leading from Hudson Strait to Amaqdjuaq cannot be very high, as
the Eskimo carry their kayaks to the lake, which I believe is about two
hundred feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>Last of all I have to mention the highlands of King Cape. The rest of
the land is taken up by a vast plain in which two large lakes are
situated; the southern, Amaqdjuaq, empties by a short river into Lake
Nettilling, whence the long and wide Koukdjuaq runs to the shallow sea.
From observations made by Captain Spicer, of Groton, Conn., and
information obtained from the Eskimo, we learn that the whole of the
eastern part of Fox Basin is extremely shallow and that there are many
low islands scattered about in those parts of the sea. The plains of
Baffin Land, Fox Basin, and the eastern half of Melville
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page417" id =
"page417">417</a></span>
Peninsula may be considered a wide basin of Silurian strata bordered by
granitic elevations on every side.</p>

<p>Besides the configuration of the land, the extent of the land ice
formed during the winter is of vital importance to the inhabitants of
the Arctic region, because during the greater part of the year it
affords the only means of communication between the tribes, and because
in winter the seal, which constitutes the principal food of the Eskimo,
takes to those parts of the coast where extensive floes are formed.
Therefore the state of the ice regulates the distribution of the natives
during the greater part of the year and must be considered in studying
the habits of the Eskimo. The extent of the land ice principally depends
on the configuration of the land and the strength of the currents. On a
shore exposed to a strong current an extensive floe can only be formed
where projecting points of land form deep bays. We find the distribution
of ice regulated in accordance with this fact all around the shores of
the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>The strong current setting out of Lancaster Sound and Smith Sound
generally prevents ice from forming under the steep cliffs of the land.
Sometimes the pack ice of the sounds is stopped and freezes together
into rough floes; a&nbsp;smooth plain is never formed. By far the
largest land floe is formed from Bylot Island to Cape Dyer (Okan). In
Home Bay it extends to a distance of about eighty miles from the
mainland. The formation of this floe is favored by a number of shoals
which extend from the peninsulas of Cape Eglinton (Aqojang), Cape Aston
(Niaqonaujang), and Qivitung, for the large floes drifting south are
stopped by the icebergs aground on these banks. The greater part of the
floe is very rough, smooth ice prevailing only in the bays.</p>

<p>The strong southerly current passing through the narrowest part of
Davis Strait between Cape Walsingham (Idjuk) and Holsteinborg breaks up
the ice all along the shore from Cape Dyer to Cape Walsingham, Exeter
Sound alone being covered by a larger floe. The bay between Cape
Mickleham (Nuvuktirpang) and Cape Mercy is well covered with ice, which
extends to the islands farthest out toward the sea.</p>

<p>Near Cape Mercy the strong tides caused by Cumberland Sound prevent
the ice from consolidating in the entrance of the gulf. As the sound
widens greatly behind the narrow passage formed by Nuvukdjuaq and
Qaχodluin, the tide sets in with great force. For this reason the floe
never extends beyond that narrow entrance. Often the head of the open
water runs from Qeqerten to Nuvujen, and instances are known where it
even reaches the line of Pujetung-Umanaq.</p>

<p>The southwestern shore of Cumberland Sound from Qaχodluin to Cape
Brevoort (Qeqertuqdjuaq) is always washed by water, because
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page418" id =
"page418">418</a></span>
a strong current, which often breaks up the ice of Field and Grinnell
Bay (the bays of Ukadliq and Nugumiut), sets along the coast.</p>

<p>The floe seldom extends to Lady Franklin and Monumental Islands
(Kitigtung and Taχolidjuin), but usually runs from point to point,
compelling the natives to pass across the land in order to reach the
floe of the neighboring bay. Most of the time the edge of the floe
covering Frobisher Bay extends to a line from Countess of Warwick Sound
(Tuarpukdjuaq) to about fifteen miles southeast of Gabriel Island
(Qeqertuqdjuaq), whence it runs south to Kingnait. Sometimes
Aqbirsiarbing (Cape True) is the most eastern point inclosed by the ice.
A&nbsp;dangerous current sets through the strait between Resolution
Island (Tudjaqdjuaq) and the mainland, forming whirlpools which menace
every ship that attempts the passage.</p>

<p>Hudson Strait never freezes over. The greater part of the year it is
filled with an immense pack which never consolidates into a continuous
floe. As there are no large bays along the northern shore of that
strait, no land floes of great importance are formed. Only the Bay of
Qaumauang, North Bay, and Behm Bay (the bay of Quaiirnang and that east
of Akuliaq) are covered with floes which are of importance to the
natives. The bays east of Akuliaq and the large fjords of that region
form a comparatively large body of ice.</p>

<p>Probably no land ice is formed between King Cape (Nuvukdjuaq) and the
northern parts of Fox Basin. According to Parry and the reports of the
natives, Fury and Hecla Strait and the bay which forms its eastern
outlet are covered by land ice which is connected with the floe of the
bays of Fox Basin as far as Piling.</p>

<p>In Hudson Bay there are very few places in which the land ice extends
to a considerable distance from the shore. Neither Frozen Strait nor
Rowe’s Welcome freezes over, each being kept open by the swiftly running
tides. The most extensive floes are formed in Repulse Bay, Wager Bay,
and Chesterfield Inlet.</p>

<p>The drifting ice of the Gulf of Boothia never consolidates and even
Committee Bay is rarely covered by a smooth land floe. Pelly Bay and the
sea on the east coast of Boothia as far as Victoria Harbor (Tikeraqdjuq)
freeze over, since they are sheltered by numerous islands. Still larger
is the sheet of ice which covers the bay formed by the estuary of Back
River, King William Land, and Boothia. The western shore of this
peninsula farther north is skirted by a border of land ice the extent of
which is unknown.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that, although the extreme western and
eastern parts of the country abound with extensive floes, the Hudson Bay
region and the Gulf of Boothia are almost devoid of them.</p>

<p>This brief sketch will enable one to understand the geographical
distribution and the migrations of the Eskimo tribes who inhabit this
country.</p>


<div class = "tribes">

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page419" id =

<h3><a name = "tribes" id = "tribes">DISTRIBUTION OF THE
TRIBES.</a></h3>

<h4><a name = "tribes_general" id = "tribes_general">GENERAL
OBSERVATIONS.</a></h4>

<p>The mode of life of all the Eskimo tribes of Northeastern America is
very uniform; therefore it is desirable to make a few general
observations on the subject before entering into a detailed description
of each tribe. All depends upon the distribution of food at the
different seasons. The migrations or the accessibility of the game
compel the natives to move their habitations from time to time, and
hence the distribution of the villages depends, to a great extent, upon
that of the animals which supply them with food.</p>

<p>As the inhospitable country does not produce vegetation to an extent
sufficient to sustain life in its human inhabitants, they are forced to
depend entirely upon animal food. In Arctic America the abundance of
seals found in all parts of the sea enables man to withstand the
inclemency of the climate and the sterility of the soil. The skins of
seals furnish the material for summer garments and for the tent; their
flesh is almost the only food, and their blubber the indispensable fuel
during the long dark winter. Scarcely less important is the deer, of
whose heavy skin the winter garments are made, and these enable the
Eskimo to brave the storms and the cold of winter.</p>

<p>That the mode of life of the Eskimo depends wholly on the
distribution of these animals will therefore be apparent, for, as
already observed, they regulate their dwelling places in accordance with
the migrations of the latter from place to place in search of food.</p>

<p>When the constraint of winter is broken the natives leave their old
habitations. The warm rays of the sun melt the roofs of their snow
houses, the strong vaults which afforded shelter and comfortable warmth
during the long cold winter begin to break down, and new houses must be
built. They therefore exchange the solid snow houses for light tents,
which are very small and poor, until a sufficient number of sealskins
for better structures is secured.</p>

<p>As at this time seals are found in abundance everywhere, basking in
the warm sunshine and enjoying the beginning of the spring, a&nbsp;great
supply is easily secured. As the season advances food becomes more
plentiful, and with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds the salmon
leave the latter and descend to the sea. About this time the Eskimo
establish their settlements at the head of the fjords, where salmon are
easily caught in the shallow rivers. In July the snow, which has covered
the land for nine months, has melted away and the natives undertake
hunting trips inland, in order to obtain the precious skins of the
reindeer and the meat of the fawns, which is always highly prized. With
the breaking up of the ice the variety
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page420" id =
"page420">420</a></span>
of food is further increased by the arrival of the walrus and the ground
and harp seals, which leave the country during the winter. Birds are
also found in abundance, and no cares afflict the natives.</p>

<p>Before the sea begins to freeze over again the Eskimo return from
deer hunting and gather at places where there are the best chances for
obtaining food in the autumn. A&nbsp;few weeks are spent in making short
excursions near the settlements, as longer journeys would be too
dangerous during this tempestuous season. The colder it grows the more
the natives are confined to their huts and the more they become
dependent on the seal. While in summer shrubs of various kinds are
available for cooking purposes, in winter blubber affords the only fuel
for cooking and for heating their huts.</p>

<p>At last the smaller bays are sufficiently frozen to permit a new way
of pursuing the game. The hunters visit the edge of the newly formed
floe in order to shoot the seals, which are secured by the harpoon.</p>

<p>The process of freezing goes on quickly and the floating pieces of
ice begin to consolidate. Only a few holes are now found, in places
where icebergs, moved by the tides or the strong currents, prevent the
sea from freezing. During a short time these openings form the favorite
hunting ground of the natives. Though the walrus and the ground seal
migrate to the edge of the floe as soon as the ice begins to form, the
common seal (<i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>) remains, and this is always the
principal food of the natives. In the autumn the fjords and the narrow
channels between the islands are its favorite haunt; later in the season
it resorts to the sea, frequently appearing at the surface through
breathing holes, which it scratches in the ice. As winter comes on it is
hunted by the Eskimo at these holes.</p>

<p>The foregoing observations will serve as a preliminary to the
description of the distribution of the tribes of Northeastern America.
The object of this section is to treat of the immediate relations
between the country and its inhabitants, and a detailed account of their
habits will be found in subsequent pages.</p>

<p class = "space">
According to Dr. H. Rink, the Inuit race may be divided into five
groups: the Greenlanders; the central tribes of Smith Sound, Baffin
Land, the west shore of Hudson Bay, the Back River region, and Boothia;
the Labradorians, on the shores of that peninsula; the Mackenzie tribes
of the central parts of the north shore of America; and the tribes of
Alaska. I&nbsp;am somewhat in doubt whether the central tribes and those
of Labrador differ enough to justify a separate classification, as the
natives of both shores of Hudson Strait seem to be closely related.
A&nbsp;decisive answer on the division of these tribes may be postponed
until the publication of Lucien M. Turner’s excellent observations and
collections, which were made at Fort Chimo.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_sikosuilarmiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_sikosuilarmiut">The Sikosuilarmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>I shall begin with the enumeration of the tribes in the southwestern
part of Baffin Land. This country is inhabited by the Sikosuilarmiut,
i.e., the inhabitants of the shore without an ice floe. They are settled
in two places: Nurata, east of King Cape, and Sikosuilaq, within the
peninsula (or&nbsp;island?) which projects east of King Cape. The large
fjords Sarbaq and Sarbausirn, which belong to their territory, are known
to me only by a description which I received in Cumberland Sound. In
summer they visit the upper parts of this long fjord to hunt deer on the
plains which reach to the shore of Fox Basin. Probably they do not
extend their migrations very far to the north or northeast; otherwise,
they would reach Lakes Amaqdjuaq and Nettilling, the region about the
latter being the hunting ground of the natives of Cumberland Sound.</p>

<p>I know of only a single meeting between the Eskimo visiting Lake
Nettilling and others who are supposed to have come from Hudson Strait.
It occurred in 1883 south of the lake.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_akuliarmiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_akuliarmiut">The Akuliarmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>This tribe is settled on the northern shore of Hudson Strait. Their
winter resort lies west of Qeqertuqdjuaq (Parry’s North Bluff). In
summer they travel through White Bear Sound or Lesseps Bay to Lake
Amaqdjuaq, which they reach after crossing a neck of land about ten
miles in width. The exact direction of the road cannot be ascertained,
as the position of their starting point, which is called Tuniqten, is
doubtful. Crossing a short portage they ascend to Lake Amitoq, whence on
a second portage they pass the watershed between Lake Amaqdjuaq and
Hudson Strait. From the small Lake Mingong a brook runs into Sioreling
and thence into Lake Amaqdjuaq (Baffin-Land, p.&nbsp;67). On the
southern shore of the large lake they erect their summer tents. Farther
east, in North Bay, there is another winter residence of the same tribe.
Unfortunately, I&nbsp;cannot specify the place of this settlement, which
is called Quaiirnang.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_qaumauangmiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_qaumauangmiut">The Qaumauangmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>East of the Akuliarmiut live the Eskimo so frequently met near Middle
Savage Islands. Their principal residence is near Lake Qaumauang, from
which they take their name Qaumauangmiut. My investigations concerning
these tribes were much embarrassed by the want of trustworthy charts. If
charts are tolerably well delineated, the Eskimo understand the meaning
of every point and island and can give detailed accounts of the
situation of the settlements and the migrations of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Between Sikosuilaq and Akuliaq but a moderate amount of intercourse
is kept up, as the settlements are separated by a wide and uninhabited
stretch of land. Notwithstanding this many members of one tribe are
found to have settled among the other. An American
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page422" id =
"page422">422</a></span>
whaling station which was established in Akuliaq a few years ago may
have had some influence upon the distribution and the life of these
tribes. The greater importance of Akuliaq, however, cannot be ascribed
to the presence of the whalers alone, as a few harbors near Sikosuilaq
are also frequently visited by them. The whalers report that there are
about fifty inhabitants in Sikosuilaq, about two hundred in Akuliaq, and
farther east fifty more. Thus the population of the north shore of
Hudson Strait probably amounts to three hundred in all.</p>

<p>The Qaumauangmiut are probably closely related to the Nugumiut of
Frobisher Bay.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_nugumiut" id = "tribes_baffin_nugumiut">The
Nugumiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>I can give a somewhat more detailed description of this tribe, among
the families of which Hall passed the winters of 1860-’61 and 1861-’62
(Hall&nbsp;I). Unfortunately, he does not give any coherent account of
their life, only meager information being furnished in the record of his
journeys. Besides, generalizations cannot be made from his two years’
experience. My own observations in Cumberland Sound may serve as a
complement to those of Hall. As he gives only a few native names of
places, it is sometimes difficult to ascertain the exact position of the
localities to which he alludes.</p>

<p>According to Hall and my own inquiries four places are inhabited by
this tribe almost every winter: Tornait (Jones Cape of Hall), about
thirty-five miles above Bear Sound, in Frobisher Bay; Operdniving and
Tuarpukdjuaq, in Countess of Warwick Sound; Nugumiut, in (Cyrus&nbsp;W.)
Field Bay; and Ukadliq, in (Cornell) Grinnell Bay. As these bays open
into Davis Strait the formation of the ice is retarded and its extent
diminished, and consequently some peculiarities in the arrangement of
the life of the Eskimo are observed here. The only occupation of the
Nugumiut and the inhabitants of Ukadliq is sealing with the harpoon on
the floe of the inner parts of the bay. Near Ukadliq the tide holes east
and west of Allen Island abound with seals. In winter, when the seals
take to the open ice, the village of this group of families is
established near Roger’s Island, where the floe of the bay forms the
hunting ground of the natives.</p>

<p>During the autumn the Nugumiut stay in Field Bay. The women are then
busy preparing the deerskins; for, on account of the requirements of
their religion, the walrus hunt cannot be begun until the deerskins
which were taken in summer have been worked up for use. As soon as this
is done they travel across Bayard Taylor Pass (so&nbsp;called by Hall)
to Frobisher Bay, and in the latter half of December or in the beginning
of January settle on Operdniving or on Tuarpukdjuaq in company with the
natives who stay here during the fall. In Cumberland Sound I learned
that this changing of the habitations takes place almost regularly and
that sometimes the settlement is moved to Aqbirsiarbing (Cape True) if
the bay is frozen
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page423" id =
"page423">423</a></span>
over beyond Operdniving. In traveling to Aqbirsiarbing the tide holes of
Ikerassaqdjuaq (Lupton Channel) are avoided by using the pass of
Chappell Inlet. Here and in Tornait the natives go sealing on the ice or
walrusing at the edge of the floe, which in most cases is not very far
off.</p>

<p>About the latter half of March part of the Eskimo begin to travel up
Frobisher Bay. In the middle of April, 1862, Hall found a settlement on
Qeqertuqdjuaq (Gabriel Island), from which island the floe edge was
visited and young seals were caught in the narrow channels between the
numerous islands. Towards the end of the month a portion of the natives
went farther to the northwest in pursuit of the basking seals
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;470), intending to reach the head of the bay in July.
Hall found summer habitations at Ukadliq (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;468); on Field
Bay (p.&nbsp;296); and on Frobisher Bay at Agdlinartung (p.&nbsp;308),
Opera Glass Point (p.&nbsp;341), Waddell Bay (p.&nbsp;341), and
Nuvuktualung, on the southern point of Beecher Peninsula
(p.&nbsp;348).</p>

<p>A very important hunting ground of the inhabitants of
Tiniqdjuarbiusirn (Frobisher Bay), of which I received some detailed
accounts, is Lake Amaqdjuaq. In the foregoing remarks on the Akuliaq
tribe I described the course which leads from Hudson Strait to the lake.
Another route is followed in traveling from the head of Frobisher Bay to
Lake Amaqdjuaq, a&nbsp;distance of about fifty miles. Probably the men
leave Sylvia Grinnell River and ascend to Lake Amartung, from which lake
a brook runs westward to Lake Amaqdjuaq (Baffin-Land, p.&nbsp;68). The
women take a different route and arrive at Aqbeniling after a tramp of
six days, near a small bay called Metja. Here the summer huts are
erected and birds and deer are killed in abundance.</p>

<p>The facility in reaching the lake from Hudson Strait and Frobisher
Bay is a very important consideration, as the Akuliarmiut and the
Nugumiut meet here, and thus an immediate intercourse between the tribes
is opened. The inhabitants of Hudson Strait leave Tuniqten in spring,
arrive at the head of Frobisher Bay in the fall, and after the formation
of the ice reach the Nugumiut settlements by means of sledges. When Hall
wintered in Field Bay a traveling party of Sikosuilarmiut which had
accomplished the distance from King Cape in one year arrived there
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;267).</p>

<p>Another route, which is practicable only for boats, connects
Qaumauang with Nugumiut. It leads along the shore of Hudson Strait. The
traveler sails through the dangerous passage between Tudjaqdjuaq
(Resolution Island) and the mainland and crosses Frobisher Bay either at
its entrance or in the shelter of the group of islands farther up the
bay.</p>

<p>In their intercourse with the Nugumiut, the inhabitants of Cumberland
Sound generally follow the long coast between Ukadliq and Naujateling,
passing through the numerous sounds formed by long,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page424" id =
"page424">424</a></span>
narrow islands. I&nbsp;can describe this region from personal
observations.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_oqomiut" id = "tribes_baffin_oqomiut">The
Oqomiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The Eskimo of Davis Strait call the tribes of Cumberland Sound and
Saumia by the name of Oqomiut. The whole of the land from Prince Regent
Inlet to the plateau of Nugumiut is divided by the Eskimo into three
parts, Aggo, Akudnirn, and Oqo&mdash;i.e., the weather side, the center,
and the lee side&mdash;and accordingly the tribes are called the
Aggomiut, Akudnirmiut, and Oqomiut.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the whole of Cumberland Sound and the coast of Davis
Strait from Cape Mercy to Exeter Sound belong to the Oqo of the Northern
Eskimo. Farther north, the inhabitants of Padli extend their migrations
from Qarmaqdjuin to Qivitung. These people occupy an intermediate
position between the Akudnirmiut and the Oqomiut, having easy
communication with both, and consequently it is doubtful to which they
belong, so that the determination of the boundary between Oqo and
Akudnirn remains arbitrary. In regard to their customs and from the
position of the land, however, they may be more properly joined to the
Akudnirmiut, of whom they would form a subdivision.</p>

<p>The names Oqo, Akudnirn, and Aggo must not be understood as
respectively meaning a region strictly limited: they denote rather
directions and the intervals between the localities situated in these
directions. In asking for the position of Oqo one would be directed
southeast, as this is considered the lee side; in the same way, if
asking for Aggo, one would be directed to the shore of Prince Regent
Inlet, the farthest land in the northwest, the weather side. In
Cumberland Sound the natives of Iglulik are considered Aggomiut, while
in Pond Bay they are known as a separate tribe. In the southern parts
the whole of the northern region is comprised in the name Aggo; in the
north Oqo means the whole of the southeastern regions.</p>

<p>Formerly, the Oqomiut were divided into four subtribes: the
Talirpingmiut, on the west shore of Cumberland Sound; the Qinguamiut, at
the head of it; the Kingnaitmiut, on the east shore; and the
Saumingmiut, on the southeastern slope of the highland of Saumia. The
names are derived from the districts which they inhabit, respectively.
As the head of every fjord is called “qingua” (its head), the upper part
of the large Cumberland Sound is also so named. The Qingua region may be
limited by Imigen on the western shore and Ussualung on the eastern
shore, though the name is applied to a region farther north; indeed, the
name covers the whole district at the head of the sound. In looking from
the head to the entrance of the sound the coasts are called according to
their position: the southwestern Talirpia, i.e., its right one, and the
northeastern Saumia, i.e., its left one; between Saumia and Qingua the
highland Kingnait,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page425" id =
"page425">425</a></span>
i.e., the higher land as compared to the opposite shore, is
situated.</p>

<p>Although at the present time this division is hardly justifiable, the
names of these four tribes are often mentioned on the shore of Davis
Strait. Their old settlements are still inhabited, but their separate
tribal identity is gone, a&nbsp;fact which is due as well to the
diminution in their numbers as to the influence of the whalers visiting
them.</p>

<p>In my opinion a great difference between these tribes never existed.
Undoubtedly they were groups of families confined to a certain district
and connected by a common life. Such a community could more easily
develop as long as the number of individuals was a large one. When the
whalers first wintered in Cumberland Sound the population may have
amounted to about 1,500. In 1840, when Penny discovered the sound, he
met 40 Eskimo in Anarnitung (Eenoolooapik, p.&nbsp;91). The greater
number of the inhabitants were at the head of the fjords fishing for
salmon, others were whaling in Issortuqdjuaq, and some were inland on a
deer hunting expedition. The whole number at that time probably amounted
to 200. A&nbsp;few years later the Kingnaitmiut of Qeqerten were able to
man eighteen whaleboats. Assuming five oarsmen and one harpooner to each
boat, the steersman being furnished by the whalers, and for each man one
wife and two children, we have in all about 400 individuals. The
inhabitants of Nettilling Fjord may have numbered as many, and 100 are
said to have lived in Imigen. Penny found in Ugjuktung about 30
individuals who belonged to the Saumingmiut and had come thither from
Davis Strait. Accordingly I estimate the whole tribe at 150 individuals.
On the southwestern coast of the sound between Nuvujen and Naujateling a
large number of natives were reported. They lived in three settlements
and numbered about 600. These estimates are not absolutely reliable, as
they are compiled largely from hearsay and conjecture. Many of the
natives being away in the summer, at the time when these estimates were
made, accuracy in their preparation was impossible. From inquiries which
were made among American whalers who had visited this sound since 1851,
the population of Qeqerten must have been larger than that of any of the
settlements contiguous to the sound. The estimation is the more
difficult as a few settlements were sometimes deserted; for instance,
Ukiadliving, in Saumia, and Qarmaqdjuin (Exeter Bay). Probably eight
settlements, with a population of 200 inhabitants each&mdash;i.e., 1,600
in the sound&mdash;would be about the true number in 1840. At first I
was inclined to believe in the existence of a larger number, but from
later reports I should consider this number too large rather than too
small. Since that time the population has diminished at a terrible rate.
In 1857 Warmow, a&nbsp;Moravian missionary who accompanied Penny,
estimated it at 300. If this was correct, the rapid diminution must have
occurred during the first years after the rediscovery of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page426" id =
"page426">426</a></span>
sound. In December, 1883, the Talirpingmiut numbered 86 individuals, the
Qinguamiut 60, the Kingnaitmiut 82, the Saumingmiut 17; total, 245.
These were distributed in eight settlements. Beginning with the most
southern settlement, the Talirpingmiut lived in Umanaqtuaq,
Idjorituaqtuin, Nuvujen, and Qarussuit; the Qinguamiut, in Imigen and
Anarnitung; the Kingnaitmiut, in Qeqerten; the Saumingmiut, in
Ukiadliving. Accordingly the population of the settlements numbered as
follows:</p>

<p>I have included in the foregoing table the inhabitants of Davis
Strait and may add that the Nugumiut number about 80, the Eskimo of Pond
Bay about 50 (?), those of Admiralty Inlet 200, and of Iglulik about
150. The total number of inhabitants of Baffin Land thus ranges between
1,000 and 1,100.</p>

<p>The reason for the rapid diminution in the population of this country
is undoubtedly to be found in the diseases which have been taken thither
by the whalers. Of all these, syphilis has made the greatest ravages
among the natives. Of other diseases I am unable to give a full account
and can only refer to those which came under my observation during the
year that I passed in this region. In Qeqerten a man died of cancer of
the rectum, two women of pneumonia, and five children of diphtheria,
this disease being first brought into the country in 1883. In Anarnitung
I knew of the death of two women and one child. On the west shore a
number of children died of diphtheria, while the health of the adults
was good. In the year 1883-’84 I heard of two births, one occurring in
Qeqerten, the other in Padli. At Qarussuit and Anarnitung there were two
abortions.</p>

<p>The opinion that the Eskimo are dying out on account of an
insufficient supply of food is erroneous, for, even though the natives
slaughter the seals without discrimination or forethought, they do
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page427" id =
"page427">427</a></span>
not kill enough to cause any considerable diminution in numbers. The
whalers do not hunt the seal to any extent, and when one realizes how
small the population of the country is and how vast the territory in
which the seal lives it is easy to understand that famine or want cannot
arise, as a rule, from the cutting off of the natural food supply. In
fact, in the spring enormous numbers of seals may be seen together
basking in the sun or swimming in the water.</p>

<p>The causes of the famines which occur somewhat frequently among the
Eskimo must be sought in another direction. Pressing need often prevails
if in the latter part of the autumn the formation of the floe is
retarded; for in that case hunters are not able either to go hunting in
boats or to procure the necessary food at the edge of the floe, as new
ice is attached to its more solid parts and the seals do not yet open
their breathing holes. Such was the case at Niaqonaujang, on Davis
Strait, in the fall of 1883. Gales of wind following in quick succession
broke the floe. The new ice which had formed immediately prevented the
natives from sealing, and in November and December a famine visited the
settlement. Very soon the supply of blubber was exhausted, and being
unable to feed the dogs the inhabitants were obliged to kill them one
after another and to live upon their frozen carcasses. Only two dogs
survived these months of need and starvation. Consequently the hunting
season was a very poor one, since the natives missed the services of
their dogs, which scent the breathing holes, and could not leave their
settlement for any great distance.</p>

<p>In winter a long spell of bad weather occasions privation, since the
hunters are then prevented from leaving the huts. If by chance some one
should happen to die during this time, famine is inevitable, for a
strict law forbids the performance of any kind of work during the days
of mourning. When this time is over, however, or at the beginning of
good weather, an ample supply is quickly secured. I&nbsp;do not know of
any cases of famine arising from the absolute want of game, but only
from the impossibility of reaching it.</p>

<p>Sometimes traveling parties that are not acquainted with the nature
of the country which they visit are in want of food. For instance,
a&nbsp;large company, consisting of three boat crews, were starved on
the eastern shore of Fox Basin, their boats being crushed by the heavy
ice and the game they expected to find in abundance having left the
region altogether. On one of the numerous islands of Nettilling a number
of women and children perished, as the men, who had been deer hunting,
were unable to find their way back to the place in which they had
erected their huts.</p>

<p>Another case of starvation is frequently mentioned by the Eskimo.
Some families who were traveling from Akuliaq to Nugumiut passed the
isthmus between Hudson Strait and Frobisher Bay. When, after a long and
tedious journey, they had reached the sea, the men left
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page428" id =
"page428">428</a></span>
their families near Qairoliktung and descended with their kayaks to
Nugumiut in order to borrow some boats in which they could bring their
families to the settlements. On the way they were detained by stormy
weather, and meanwhile the families were starved and resorted to
cannibalism. One woman especially, by the name of Megaujang, who ate all
her children, was always mentioned with horror.</p>

<p>Generally food is plentiful between the months of April and October
and an ample supply may be secured without extraordinary exertion.
During the winter sealing is more difficult, but sufficiently successful
to prevent any want, except in the case of continuous bad weather.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to a description of the single settlements of
Cumberland Sound. Separated from the Nugumiut by a long and uninhabited
stretch of land we find the settlement of Naujateling, the most southern
one of the Talirpingmiut. In the fall the natives erect their huts on
the mainland or on an island near it, as the seal, at this season,
resort to the narrow channels and to the fjords. Besides, the shelter
which is afforded by the islands against the frequent gales is an
important consideration, and in these protected waters the natives can
manage their frail boats, which would not live for a moment in the
tempestuous open sea. Later in the season the ice consolidates in the
shelter of the islands, while beyond the bays and channels drifting
floes fill the sea.</p>

<p>After the consolidation of the pack ice the natives move their huts
to the sea. They leave Naujateling about December and move to
Umanaqtuaq. I&nbsp;do not know exactly where they live if the water
reaches that island. Should this happen, the floe between Qaχodluin,
Umanaqtuaq, and Idjorituaqtuin would offer a productive hunting
ground.</p>

<p>About the middle of March the season for hunting the young seal
opens. The hunt is prosecuted with much energy over the entire extent of
Cumberland Sound, because the white coat of the young animal is of prime
importance for the inner garments. The pregnant females take to the
rough ice, where deep snowbanks have been formed by the winter gales,
and dig large excavations, in which parturition takes place. Another
favorite place is the ground ice on gradually declining shores, where
large caves are found between the broken pieces of ice. Therefore the
fjords and islands which offer a long coast line furnish a good hunting
ground, and in the latter part of March and in April the Eskimo either
visit these regions or the floes of rough ice. At such times they
sometimes live for a long period on the ice of the open sea in order to
be nearer to their hunting ground. As the success of the hunt depends on
the extent of ice visited, the Eskimo scatter over a large area, almost
every one traveling over a separate tract.</p>

<p>At this time the winter settlements are almost totally broken up.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page429" id =
"page429">429</a></span>
Some of the natives of Naujateling go bear hunting instead of “young
sealing,” but only a few polar bears lose their way into Cumberland
Sound. They are generally found within a few miles of the floe edge, and
even if the water reaches pretty far up the sound they do not travel
beyond Qaχodluin and Miliqdjuaq, nor does the pack ice carry them far up
the sound in summer. On one occasion, in the year 1880, three bears were
seen near Qeqerten, about five years earlier one was killed in Qingua,
and almost twenty years earlier another one near Anarnitung. Every
occurrence of this kind is considered an event of such importance that
it is talked about for years afterwards. I&nbsp;myself saw bear tracks
in Kouaqdjuaq in March, 1884, and also at Miliqdjuaq. In February a bear
was killed between Kautaq and Naujateling.</p>

<p>If the water washes the foot of the cliffs between Kautaq and Sulung,
the Eskimo cross the isthmus which lies between Ijelirtung, the eastern
branch of Qasigidjen, and Qaχodluin Bay on a sledge road and hunt among
the islands that are scattered along the shore south of Qaχodluin. In
summer they visit the same region on their hunting excursions.</p>

<p>The principal summer settlements are at the head of Qasigidjen and
Kangertlung Fjords, which are situated near Idjorituaqtuin and
Qimissung.</p>

<p>From here they ascend the plateau of Nugumiut and hunt on the level
highlands. I&nbsp;think it takes them but a day to travel to the top of
the plateau. They travel from Qasigidjen to Agdlinartung, a&nbsp;fjord
of Frobisher Bay, whence the Nugumiut ascend the highland. Another route
leads from Kangertlung to Eχaluin, near the head of Frobisher Bay.</p>

<p>Farther up the sound we find the winter settlement of Idjorituaqtuin.
The same relation exists between this place and Qimissung as between
Umanaqtuaq and Naujateling. On Qimissung, which lies near the mainland,
the natives gather in the fall after returning from deer hunting, and
only move to Idjorituaqtuin after the freezing up of the sea. Deer are
hunted inland, the summer settlements being at the head of one of the
numerous fjords of the west shore. Favorite places are Kangertlung,
which is also visited by the Naujateling Eskimo; Eχaluin, which can be
reached from Kangertlung by a short overland road; Auqardneling; and
Utiqimitung, at the entrance of Nettilling Fjord. A&nbsp;large river,
which, according to Eskimo reports, runs through the greater part of the
peninsula, empties into Auqardneling. As it is very deep and wide it
cannot be crossed without a vessel of some character, and thus it puts a
stop to the migrations from Kangertlung and Eχaluin. In traveling from
Kangertlung to Frobisher Bay the river must be crossed. To accomplish
this the natives fill a deerskin with shrubs, sew it up, and float
themselves across. Only the road leading from Qasigidjen to Frobisher
Bay avoids the river.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page430" id =
"page430">430</a></span>
<p>North of Idjorituaqtuin we find the winter settlement of Nuvujen with
the fall settlement, Nuvujalung, a&nbsp;high cliff at the entrance of
Nettilling Fjord, belonging to it.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting branch of the Talirpingmiut are the
inhabitants of Nettilling Fjord. Among all the tribes of Baffin Land
this one claims particular attention, as it is the only one whose
residence is not limited to the seashore. From Greenland to the mouth of
the Mackenzie only two Eskimo tribes are known who do not live all the
year round on the coast of the sea. These are the Talirpingmiut and the
Kinipetu of Chesterfield Inlet. Back and Anderson and Stewart say that
the latter tribe spend a great part of the year at the lakes of Back
River.</p>

<p>Formerly the Talirpingmiut had three or four settlements on Lake
Nettilling: at Tikeraqdjung, near the south point of the lake; at the
outlet of Koukdjuaq, on the left bank of the river, opposite to
Nikosiving Island; at Qarmang; and probably a fourth one, on the north
shore. As the lake abounds with seals, they could live here at all
seasons. Its western part seems to have been particularly fitted for
winter stations. In the winter of 1877-’78, three families staid near
Koukdjuaq without encountering any considerable difficulty in procuring
food. This was the last time that natives passed the winter at the lake;
the greater portion of the tribe may have retreated to Nettilling Fjord
about twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Though the Eskimo assert that the discovery of Lake Nettilling is of
recent date, naming two men, Kadlu and Sagmu, as those who first reached
it, this assertion is not trustworthy, for with them almost every
historical tradition is supposed to have originated a comparatively
short time ago. I&nbsp;was told, for instance, that an event which is
the subject of the tale Igimarasugdjuqdjuaq the cannibal occurred at the
beginning of this century, and yet the tradition is told almost word for
word in Greenland and in Labrador.</p>

<p>Just so with Kadlu and Sagmu. According to the assertion of the
natives the lake was discovered by the generation before the
last&mdash;i.e., about 1810&mdash;and yet an old woman about
seventy-five years of age told me that her grandfather when a young man,
starting from Nettilling, had visited Iglulik and that he had lived on
the lake. The customs and habits of the Eskimo would have led to the
discovery of the lake very soon after the first visit to Cumberland
Sound, and no doubt their attention was then called to the abundance of
game in this region.</p>

<p>The greater part of the natives spent the winter in Nettilling Fjord,
starting on their way inland about the beginning of May, and returning
to the sea about December. I&nbsp;suppose that cases in which men spent
their whole life on the lake were exceptional, for they are referred to
by the natives as remarkable events. For instance, a&nbsp;man called
Neqsiang, who had two wives, lived on a small island near
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page431" id =
"page431">431</a></span>
Koukdjuaq and never descended to Cumberland Sound. A&nbsp;few times only
he is said to have sent his son to barter with the Talirpingmiut of
Nettilling Fjord. He came to Qarussuit in the spring, but returned after
a short stay. It may be remarked here that the total absence of salt
does not prevent the natives from staying on Lake Nettilling.</p>

<p>About 1850 the mode of life of the Talirpingmiut was as follows: In
November they gathered in Isoa, the easternmost bay of the lake,
descended toward the sea, and lived during the following months at the
entrance of Nettilling Fjord. There they lived in the same manner as the
other Oqomiut, pursuing the seals at their breathing holes. In the
spring they hunted young seals; but, when the other natives began to
prepare for whaling, they traveled on sledges westward. They avoided the
large tide holes of the long fjord by making use of a few passes.
Although the fjord is impassable in spring, a&nbsp;safe road leads along
its northern shore to its northern branch, Kangertlukdjuaq, where the
water hole Sarbaqdualung may be avoided by crossing the land at
Tunukutang. In the spring large water holes are formed near Neqemiarbing
and at the entrance of Audnerbing, compelling travelers to pass over the
island which separates the two passages of Sarbaqdualung. The pass
Tunukutang, which is used in winter, consists of a steep and narrow neck
of land, which separates a small lake from Kangertlukdjuaq, and a short
and winding river, the outlet of the lake. The second tide hole of the
fjord may be passed by the branches Qasigidjen and Sarbaqdjukulu and the
adjoining flat isthmus. The holes of Qognung, yet farther up the fjord,
do not hinder the natives, as they do not occupy the whole width of the
floe.</p>

<p>At length they reached Kangia, and from here a chain of small lakes
was ascended, the watershed Ujaraqdjuin was crossed, and finally they
arrived at Amitoq. Cairns are everywhere erected on prominent points for
way marks. After they had come to Lake Nettilling, they rested a short
time at Isoa, where the skin boats and the necessary household goods had
been left the preceding fall. These were lashed upon the sledges and
then they traveled as quickly as possible to the west. After following
the southeastern shore to Tikeraqdjuaq they crossed the lake to a point
near Tikeraqdjung, whence they went along the southern shore of the
lake, reaching Koukdjuaq in about a fortnight. Here their tents were
established on the left bank of the river, opposite to Nikosiving, where
they staid until the breaking up of the ice. Then the men descended the
river in their kayaks. Four days they followed the coast, passing the
bay of Aggirtijung before they reached Qudjitariaq, a&nbsp;long and deep
river, which they ascended. For a few weeks they hunted deer among the
lakes of this region, which is called Majoraridjen, and then slowly
turned southward. At last, about the latter half of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page432" id =
"page432">432</a></span>
August, they reached Qarmang, where at the beginning of summer the women
and old men had arrived in their large boats. Here the whole party
stopped until the lake was frozen up. Then they returned on sledges to
Isoa and to the sea.</p>

<p>It would be very interesting to learn how far the natives formerly
extended their migrations along the shore of Fox Basin and whether a
regular intercourse existed between Iglulik and Cumberland Sound.
According to reports of some old Eskimo, who had themselves passed the
winter on the lake, there was always a small settlement at Qarmang. From
here the shore of Fox Basin was reached with great ease. If, however,
the route through Koukdjuaq had to be taken, a&nbsp;long, roundabout way
was necessary. According to all reports, even in olden times expeditions
to Iglulik were very rare. It is said that one was made about 1750 by a
party under the leadership of an Eskimo, Makulu. About 1800 another
party left, in which Kotuko assumed the leadership. About these a more
detailed account exists. With a few boats and four kayaks they left
Nettilling and followed the coast. Alone in his kayak, Kotuko visited
Sagdlirn, an island east of Iglulik, but he did not see any people, as
they were on a hunting excursion. He found one hut and a large dog.
There were a great number of deerskins and walrus tusks, which proved
the existence of an abundance of game. He returned, but on account of
the prevailing fog could scarcely find his kayak. The absence of the
party is said to have lasted three years.</p>

<p>About 1820 another party left for Iglulik, among whom two women,
Amaroq and Sigjeriaq, were the most prominent. When they returned, after
an absence of three years, they praised the country (Piling), where they
had spent some time, as a land of plenty and abundance, and by these
tales, in 1835, induced three boat crews to leave Nettilling in order to
visit this happy land. They were grievously disappointed and after many
misfortunes they perished on the narrow isthmus of Ipiuting. Their
bodies were found by the Iglulik Eskimo, who related that the poor
fellows had resorted to cannibalism. Among those who perished was a
sister of the famous Hannah (Taqulitu), the companion of Hall in his
travels in the Arctic. I&nbsp;must mention here that Hall, in 1868, met
a native at Iglulik who was said to belong to Cumberland Sound. As,
however, in Iglulik Cumberland Sound and Davis Strait are often
confounded, I&nbsp;am inclined to think he was a native of the latter
region.</p>

<p>From these facts it appears that a regular intercourse between the
tribes along the shore of Fox Basin never existed, though formerly
interviews were more frequent than they are at present. Since the last
mentioned expedition no Eskimo has visited Piling, nor have any gone by
the way of Lake Nettilling to Iglulik. Accordingly the ideas of the
Oqomiut about that region are very indefinite. An old man
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page433" id =
"page433">433</a></span>
was the only person whom I could find who knew Iglulik by name and
remembered Ingnirn and Piling, two places which had been inhabited by
many Eskimo. He mentioned another inhabited region beyond Iglulik,
Augpalugtijung, which I was not able to identify. It was described as a
large peninsula.</p>

<p>It is worth remarking that the Talirpingmiut seem never to have
traveled over the country south of Koukdjuaq. I&nbsp;have not even heard
mentioned a single hunting excursion made in this direction.</p>

<p>In the foregoing paragraphs I have described the mode of life of the
greater part of the Talirpingmiut. Still another part staid in
Cumberland Sound until the ice had gone and went away in the latter half
of July. The passage through the rapids of the fjords was very
dangerous, as in the whirlpools and overfalls the bulky boats were
easily capsized. Therefore the changing of the tides had to be
considered in order to effect a safe passage. The men preferred carrying
the kayaks over the passes in order to avoid the dangers imminent to
their frail crafts. Even up to this day tradition tells of a disaster
which happened when the stubborn owner of a boat, against the warning of
his friends, tried to pass Sarbaqdualung when the spring tide was
running swiftly. The boat was upset and the crew were drowned, with the
exception of one woman, who was saved on a bundle of deerskins.</p>

<p>From Kangia boats had to be carried over the portages Igpirto,
Igpirtousirn, and Ujaraqdjuin. The rapids of Angmartung were also
avoided by a portage over the level bottom of the valley. After passing
Taquirbing, Lake Nettilling was reached, on the shore of which the huts
were erected. In the fall the party returned before the beginning of the
cold season. It has been already mentioned that only a few of the
natives staid at the lake during the entire year, and even among these
there were some who descended to the sea in March to take part in the
young sealing, for the skins of the young seal cannot be altogether
replaced by deerskins.</p>

<p>At the present time it is exceptional for any one to remain inland
during the entire year. There may be seals enough in the lake to prevent
hunger or starvation, but they are taken much more easily from the sea.
In case of a lack of blubber, deer’s marrow may be used for fuel. It is
probable that the high mortality of recent years has induced the Eskimo
to band together more closely than they formerly did and to adopt the
plan of returning to Nettilling Fjord at the beginning of winter. In the
fall the boats and other articles which are of no use in winter are left
in Isoa, and some time is spent in Kangia, where snow houses are built.
Here the kayaks are left, and in December, when the sealing begins to be
more successful near the sound, the Eskimo turn to the entrance of
Nettilling Fjord, where Tininiqdjuaq and Neqemiarbing are favorite
places. Seals are hunted there with the harpoon in the same way as in
the other settlements
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page434" id =
"page434">434</a></span>
or Sarbaqdualung is visited for the purpose of shooting seals which
frequent the tide holes. This, however, is not a favorite way of
hunting, as the ice near the tide holes is very rough and
treacherous.</p>

<p>In March and April young seals are caught on the shores of the
numerous islands between Tininiqdjuaq and Nuvujalung, and at the same
time the old settlements are left, as large water holes begin to appear.
Qarussuit and Qingaseareang are the favorite places about this time of
the year.</p>

<p>As soon as the young sealing is finished the hunt of the basking seal
is opened, which is very successful here. Nowhere else did I see such
large numbers of animals enjoying the warmth of the sun as in Nettilling
Fjord. In April, when on the east shore scarcely any dared to leave the
water, hundreds might be seen here. By the first of May all the natives
have procured a sufficient number of sealskins for their summer dress,
the skins being then in the best condition, as the first moulting has
just occurred. This done, they eagerly prepare for the journey to the
lake.</p>

<p>The natives start in the first week of May, and in two or three days
arrive at Kangia, whence they reach Isoa in one day’s journey. Following
the southern shore of Lake Nettilling they sleep the first night on
Tikeraqdjuausirn, the second on the island Manirigtung, near
Tikeraqdjuaq, and five days after leaving Qarussuit arrive at
Tikeraqdjung, where they settle for the summer. As numerous deer are
found in this region, they live without any care or trouble. Very soon
after their arrival the birds return. While moulting great quantities of
these are caught. The geese are so abundant here that they are fed to
the dogs. Many deer are caught while passing the deep river which runs
from Lake Amaqdjuaq to Lake Nettilling. Frequently they visit the
southern plains, which are filled with lakes and lakelets. Sometimes
they go as far as Amaqdjuaq, which, as the older natives report, was
formerly a summer settlement.</p>

<p>In the river whose outlet is near Padli salmon are caught in
abundance. In this district the Talirpingmiut stay until the eastern
part of the lake is frozen over.</p>

<p>In the shelter of the islands the floe is more quickly formed than in
the open water of the western part, and in November the natives return
by sledges to Isoa.</p>

<p>As they take with them heavy loads of deerskins they make very slow
progress and generally arrive at their place of destination after six
days of traveling. Sometimes they make a short trip to Isoa in March or
April to hunt deer or to look for the things which were left behind in
Kangia and Isoa at the time of their last departure.</p>

<p>Besides the Talirpingmiut quite a number of Cumberland Sound natives
visit the lake by means of boats. They cross the sound after the
breaking up of the ice and go to Nettilling, carrying the boats over the
portages between Kangia and Isoa. As the Talirpingmiut
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page435" id =
"page435">435</a></span>
have no boats they stay at Tikeraqdjuaq; the other natives, however,
sometimes change their habitations and even visit Qarmang and the north
shore of the lake. These journeys, however, are rare, for in the eastern
part an inexhaustible supply of food may be obtained; therefore long
excursions are quite unnecessary. At the beginning of October the boats
leave the lake and the natives return to the fall settlements in the
sound.</p>

<p>Nettilling Fjord, with its numerous islands, forms the northern
boundary of Talirpia. Farther north we come to Qingua, the head of
Tiniqdjuarbing (Cumberland Sound). It extends from Imigen to Ussualung.
The winter settlement on the island of Imigen is situated in the midst
of one of the best winter hunting grounds, for the southern portion of
the island, on which the huts are erected, projects far out into the
sea. The hunt is often rendered somewhat difficult by the rough ice
which is due to the strong currents between Pujetung, Imigen, and
Nettilling Fjord. Towards spring the natives sometimes resort to a place
yet nearer the open sea, the largest island of the Pujetung group. Young
seals are caught near Imigen, at the Kilauting Islands, and in
Qaggilortung. This district, however, cannot be visited every year, as
almost every spring the whole area west of a line from Imigen to
Anarnitung is covered with very deep and soft snow, which prevents the
Eskimo from using their dog sledges. When this condition prevails the
natives settle on the sea ice between Augpalugtung and Imigen, or a
little farther north, and remain there from the middle of March until
the latter part of April.</p>

<p>These natives go deer hunting either to Issortuqdjuaq&mdash;where
they live at Eχaluaqdjuin, Sirmiling, or Midlurieling&mdash;or to
Eχaluqdjuaq, near Ussualung, where they hunt in the hilly land adjoining
the ice-covered Penny Plateau. As the land farther northwest is said to
consist of irregular hills and disconnected valleys, the skins and the
meat of the killed deer would have to be carried up and down hills
before the settlement was reached. Therefore the natives dislike hunting
in this part of the country.</p>

<p>Eχaluaqdjuin and Eχaluqdjuaq, as is denoted by the names, are
productive salmon rivers. In starting from the former and ascending a
narrow valley, Lake Eχoleaqdjuin is reached, whence a pass leads to the
valley adjoining Eχaluaqdjuin. Taking another road the long Lake
Imeraqdjuaq is reached, which borders upon the glaciers of the highland.
From here, after a four days’ tramp following a large river, the
traveler comes to Midlurieling. From Issortuqdjuaq a narrow isthmus
offering a good sledging road is used in visiting the head of
Qaggilortung. Another route, which is suitable only for foot passengers,
leads by a chain of lakes to the head of Kangertlukdjuaq. It is not
necessary to enumerate the overland routes in this district, as numerous
valleys permit the traveler to pass from the east to the west and from
the south to the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page436" id =
"page436">436</a></span>
north. In the fall the natives resort to Saunirtung or to
Saunirtuqdjuaq, two islands northwest of Imigen, where they stay until
January, when they return to the sea.</p>

<p>The second settlement of the Qinguamiut is Anarnitung, at the
northern entrance of Qaggilortung. The small island and the neighboring
point of Igdlungajung are, next to Qeqerten, the seat of the most
important settlement of Cumberland Sound. On the southern and eastern
declivity of the low hills which form this island are a number of very
old stone foundations (see <a href = "#page549">p.&nbsp;549</a>), such
as are found everywhere on the Arctic shores of North America
(Baffin-Land, p.&nbsp;77).</p>

<p>If the ice in the upper parts of the sound is smooth, families
belonging to this community settle on Kilauting, the largest island of a
group running from northwest to southeast a few miles north of Imigen.
Here they go sealing with the harpoon. If the ice, however, is rough
(as&nbsp;it happened to be during my stay in Cumberland Sound), they
remain in Anarnitung, whence some go to the water holes at the entrance
of Issortuqdjuaq and shoot the blowing seals, while others go hunting on
the ice near Anarnitung.</p>

<p>During the young sealing season they almost always leave the island.
The favorite resort at this season is Sakiaqdjung, near Manituling, in
Qaggilortung, but heavy snowfalls often compel them to exchange this
region for the open sea. If they insist upon stopping there, snowshoes
are used as the only means of traveling in the deep and soft snow. In
1878, when the Florence wintered in Anarnitung Harbor, the greater part
of the natives remained near the ship; but her presence is accountable
for this exception, as some of the families were in her service and
others staid near her in order to barter seals, skins, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of some importance are the passes leading around the numerous water
holes at the head of Cumberland Sound. The narrow island of Nudnirn,
which separates Sarbuqdjuaq from Putukin, offers a good passage by way
of a deep valley. Should the passage be made in a mild winter or in
spring, when the water holes of Sarbuqdjuaq have enlarged, they must
avoid the latter by passing over the inconvenient isthmus of
Itidliaping, west of the steep cliff Naujan.</p>

<p>In spring the tide holes of Kangidliuta extend over the passage
between that island and Surosirn, preventing sledges from passing to
Issortuqdjuaq or to Tessiujang. Then Qaχodlualung is crossed by the way
of Naqoreang or the more southerly Tappitariaq, which leads into the
sound near Siegtung. Both passes are very inconvenient. From Tessiujang,
Issortuqdjuaq may be reached by the fjords Ugjuktung and Itijareling and
by the adjoining passes.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have to mention the road formerly used by the natives of
Anarnitung in traveling to Nettilling. They crossed the entrance of
Qaggilortung and ascended Tarrionitung, whence they came by the Lakes
Qamusiojodlang and Irtiujang to Missirtung, in Nettilling
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page437" id =
"page437">437</a></span>
Fjord, thus avoiding a much longer journey around the large peninsula
projecting to the eastward. A&nbsp;similar pass farther east connects
Tornait and Kangertlukjuaq.</p>

<p>The ruins of a third settlement of the Qinguamiut are found at
Tulukan on Qeqertelung.</p>

<p>The next subtribe to be treated is the Kingnaitmiut, who are now
located exclusively upon Qeqerten. Formerly they lived in several
places&mdash;for instance, near Pangnirtung and on Miliaqdjuin&mdash;but
for a long time they have gathered on Qeqerten, as two whaling stations
are established here, many natives being in the service of the whalers.
The island is the largest settlement of the sound. It is a favorite
resort during the fall and the first part of winter. In November and
December, before the ice of the sound consolidates, the ice east of the
islands is the best hunting ground. Later that west of the islands is
preferred. There is one disadvantage peculiar to Qeqerten which is not
shared by the other settlements, namely, the fohn-like winds which often
blow for many days from Kingnait Fjord with irresistible violence. These
confine the natives to their huts, though a few miles north or south
calm weather prevails. Should fair weather ensue, the snow, which has
been firmly packed by these gales, affords a good hunting ground; but
if, on the other hand, long spells of bad weather follow, want and
hunger may be the result. The young seals are eagerly pursued all about
Qeqerten.</p>

<p>In Pangnirtung and in the little valley Niutang, in Kingnait, well up
in these fjords, are the ruins of two large, ancient settlements. The
conditions which formerly enabled the natives to live here will be
mentioned later.</p>

<p>The Kingnaitmiut go deer hunting to Kitingujang, at the head of
Kingnait Fjord; to Nirdlirn, in the bay behind Augpalugtung and
Sednirun; to Pangnirtung; or to the more southern fjords Eχaluaqdjuin
and Kangertlukdjuaq.</p>

<p>I shall describe the districts occupied by the Kingnaitmiut,
Saumingmiut, and Padlimiut together, as they all bear a uniform
character.</p>

<p>From Nirdlirn the mountains of Ussualung or the highland near
Ukiuqdjuaq are visited. The same country is traveled over from
Pangnirtung, where the settlement is established either above Qordlubing
or opposite Aulitiving. The deep valley, with its numerous glaciers,
adjoining Pangnirtung and connecting Cumberland Sound and Davis Strait
is rarely visited.</p>

<p>The favorite place for the settlement is Kitingujang in Kingnait. In
the river which empties here many salmon are caught, and the declivities
of the neighboring highlands, which are less steep than those of
Pangnirtung, afford ample opportunity for long hunting excursions. Deer
are found on the mountains, for here they escape
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page438" id =
"page438">438</a></span>
the mosquitoes which swarm in the valleys. The natives do not go beyond
Padli, but most of them have been there. They often travel through the
valleys of Nerseqdjuaq and Tunussung to Pangnirtung, of Davis Strait,
down the eastern shore of which they go a considerable distance.
Sometimes they make boat excursions during the summer from Kitingujang,
visiting the brooks which empty into Kingnait Fjord, or they settle in
Tornait, whence Tupirbikdjuin in Pangnirtung is accessible by the wide
valleys surrounding Angiuqaq.</p>

<p>I may omit the description of the separate summer habitations farther
south, for the head of every fjord and every valley that is a means of
reaching the interior are used for erecting the tents. The interior of
the region, which is covered with ice, remains unvisited, no game being
found there. Therefore it may be said in general that the Eskimo are
limited to the peninsulas formed by the numerous fjords.</p>

<p>The Saumingmiut visit the southern fjords of Cumberland Peninsula,
where I have marked the settlements on the chart. Here they pursue deer
and polar bears, which frequently come down to Cape Mercy during the
summer.</p>

<p>An important summer settlement of the Saumingmiut is Touaqdjuaq, from
which place they visit the peninsula limited by Exeter Sound and
Touaqdjuaq. An important summer station of both Saumingmiut and
Padlimiut is Qarmaqdjuin, while Eχaloaping (Durban Harbor of the
whalers), near the entrance of Padli, is visited only by the latter
tribe.</p>

<p>The number of deer on Cumberland Peninsula is so variable that the
result of the hunt is often unsatisfactory. Although in some seasons
numerous herds are met, in others scarcely enough animals are killed to
afford a sufficient stock of skins for the winter clothing. Early in the
spring the deer pass quite regularly through Itidlirn (the lower part of
Padli Valley, between Ikaroling and Padli), in their migrations from
Narpaing to Qarmaqdjuin. I&nbsp;was told that in both the latter
districts many deer can be found at all times.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have to describe the winter settlements of the Saumingmiut.
They are in the habit of separating in the fall, part of them staying
during winter on Qeqertaujang, in Ugjuktung, and the remainder at
Ukiadliving, on Davis Strait.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, walrus are not found in the upper part of the
sound, while farther south they are abundant. Akuliaχating, east of
Qeqerten, is the most northern point that they visit. It is said that in
former times they were met with everywhere in the sound, and indeed some
of the local names give evidence of the truth of these traditions; for
instance, the name of Uglirn (which is always applied to walrus
islands), in the fjord Qaggilortung, and that of Anarnitung
(a&nbsp;place having a bad smell from walrus excrement), at the head of
the sound.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page439" id =
"page439">439</a></span>
<p>Before Cumberland Sound begins to freeze up, the Eskimo of Ugjuktung
take walrus on the islands Uglirn, south of Qeqertaujang, and at
Qeqertaq in Anartuajuin. The animals killed during the fall are buried
under stones, and with this stock of provisions the Saumingmiut do not
suffer want during the winter. In addition, however, they go sealing at
the entrance of Ugjuktung, or travel overland to Kangertloaping,
a&nbsp;branch of Kouaqdjuaq, as Nuvukdjuaq is almost always washed by
water and cannot be passed in winter. The young sealing is here of
little importance, as the bears visit the fjords about this season and
frighten the animals away. In March the natives go bear hunting or move
up the sound to join the Kingnaitmiut during the time of young sealing.
In the spring the settlement is always abandoned, as most of them go to
Davis Strait and join the other part of the tribe. Crossing the country,
they travel over a pass leading from Anartuajuin to
Ujaradjiraaitjung.</p>

<p>The favorite settlement on the east coast is Ukiadliving. There are
several stone foundations in this place which are frequently
reconstructed and used as dwellings. Here walrus are hunted in the
summer and in the fall and a great stock of provisions is laid up. In
winter the floe offers a good hunting ground for sealing and in the
spring the bears visit the land and the islands to pursue the pupping
(i.e., pregnant or parturient) seals. At the same time the she bear
brings forth her young, the meat and skin of which are highly prized.
Many old bears and cubs are killed at this season and the precious skins
are prepared for sale.</p>

<p>Besides the beforementioned route another and longer one leads to
Cumberland Sound. In taking this course the sledges start from
Nedluqseaq, west of Ukiadliving, and follow a river which rises in a
small lake whence the inland ice is ascended. Farther on the valley
leading to Eχaluaqdjuin and Kangertlukdjuaq is reached. This is the only
overland route on which the inland ice is crossed. Cape Mercy can be
passed by a number of short isthmuses. In the shelter of the bay formed
by the cape and Muingmang a floe is formed reaching to the foot of
Uibarun (Cape Mercy). The pass Tappitaridjen, which cuts off two
peninsulas, leads into the sound. The bays farther west are frozen up
and the projecting points are avoided by short passes. Unfortunately
this road was unknown to me during my stay in Saumia, else I could have
easily visited Cape Mercy. At last Anartuajuin is reached. The water
rarely extends to Nuvukdjuaraqdjung, the point between Anartuajuin and
Ugjuktung. It may be passed by a difficult road leading across the
peninsula. If the water extends to Iliqimisarbing a pass is used which
is ascended from Eχalualuin, in the bay of Naujaqdjuaq.</p>

<p>On Davis Strait a few important isthmuses must be mentioned. One is
used by the inhabitants of Ukiadliving in traveling to Exeter Sound.
They leave the sea at the head of Touaqdjuaq and by a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page440" id =
"page440">440</a></span>
difficult overland route cross to the southern shore of Exeter Sound.
Much of the time the ice and snow near Udlimaulitelling make the route
almost impassable in that direction. If, therefore, this route is
impracticable or that through Touaqdjuaq is too difficult on account of
the absence of snow, the journey is postponed until late in spring, when
the hummocks begin to be leveled off and the snow becomes harder as it
settles; then the rough ice can be passed, and after reaching Ituatukan,
a&nbsp;fjord near Cape Walsingham, the Eskimo ascend it, so as to avoid
the cape, which is always washed by water. If snow and ice are in a
suitable condition the passage by way of Ituatukan is always
preferred.</p>

<p>From Exeter Sound Kangertlukdjuaq, in Padli Fjord, may be reached by
a pass of short extent; but the snow is always so deep here that the
passage cannot be effected until June. The peninsulas between Padli
Fjord and Exeter Sound, which have no ice foot, can be crossed by narrow
isthmuses near the head of the bays.</p>

<p>Before leaving Cumberland Sound and its inhabitants, the Oqomiut,
altogether, I&nbsp;wish to add a few remarks on the whale fishery, which
the Eskimo formerly carried on in their bulky skin boats. They pursued
the monstrous animal in all waters with their imperfect weapons, for a
single capture supplied them with food and fuel for a long time.
I&nbsp;do not know with certainty whether the natives used to bring
their boats to the floe edge in the spring in order to await the arrival
of the whales, as the Scotch and American whalers do nowadays, or
whether the animals were caught only in summer. On Davis Strait the
Padlimiut and the Akudnirmiut used to erect their tents in June near the
floe edge, whence they went whaling, sending the meat, blubber, and
whalebone to the main settlement. In Cumberland Sound whales were caught
in all the fjords, particularly in Kingnait, Issortuqdjuaq, and the
narrow channels of the west shore. Therefore the Eskimo could live in
the fjords during the winter, as the provisions laid up in the fall
lasted until spring. If, therefore, there is a perceptible diminution in
the supply of their food it is due to the fact that the whale fishery
has been abandoned by them or rather has been yielded up to Europeans
and Americans. It is not probable, however, that a sufficient number of
whales were ever caught to support the entire population during the
whole of the winter. The whaling is still kept up by the Eskimo of
Hudson Strait and Hudson Bay, though only to a limited extent, owing to
the visits of whaling ships and the establishment of whaling
stations.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_padlimiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_padlimiut">The Padlimiut and the
Akudnirmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The next tribes to be described are the Padlimiut and the
Akudnirmiut, but this may be done very briefly, as the nature of this
region is similar to that of Saumia. A&nbsp;peculiarity of the
Akudnirmiut is their more decided migratory character as compared with
the Oqomiut. They do not spend every winter at the same place, as we
observed that the Oqomiut do, but
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page441" id =
"page441">441</a></span>
are more inclined to visit, in turn, the different winter stations of
their country.</p>

<p>In summer the following places are almost always inhabited:
Qarmaqdjuin, Eχaloaping in Padli Fjord, Qivitung, and Niaqonaujang. The
deer hunting season opens here at the same time as farther south, but it
is much facilitated from the fact that the ice breaks up later. The deer
visit the numerous islands scattered along the mainland and thus their
pasturing ground is easily reached. As the islands of Home Bay
constitute a good hunting ground the Eskimo sometimes settle there for a
few weeks.</p>

<p>The long, low peninsula Pamiujang, near Nedluqseaq, and the head of
Nudlung are the favorite summer settlements of the Padlimiut. Nudlung,
Eχalualuin, Ijelirtung, and Inugsuin are visited by the Akudnirmiut. An
abundance of deer is found along the southern part of Home Bay, where
the plains extend to the sea. It is remarkable that all along this shore
there is no island on which birds build their nests. Though fowls do not
form an important constituent of the food of the Oqomiut and the more
southern tribes, the egg islands are frequently visited. On Davis Strait
it is only by chance that ducks &amp;c. are caught, and eggs can
scarcely be obtained. The only island which is visited by birds is
Avaudjelling, in Home Bay. In July, however, large flocks of eider ducks
descend Itirbilung Fjord and many are caught near its head. From this
fjord an overland route, which is practicable only in summer, leads to
Piling, a&nbsp;district on the shore of Fox Basin, which may be reached
in three days. Though the route is well known, it seems to be passing
into disuse; at least I do not know any natives who have crossed the
land by it. Another interesting road leading overland must be mentioned,
namely, the one which leads from Nudlung and Eχalualuin to Majoraridjen
and Nettilling. The former region is still visited by the Akudnirmiut,
but I know of but one family who went to Nettilling and wintered
there.</p>

<p>As a rule, about the beginning of August the Akudnirmiut move to
Niaqonanjang in order to have an opportunity of meeting the whalers on
their way south. For the same reason the southern families gather at
Qivitung.</p>

<p>As soon as the sea is frozen up, part of the natives of Qivitung move
southward and settle on Qeqertuqdjuaq, where they stay until February,
while in spring some stay here or move farther up the bay, where they
establish their huts on Qeqertaq; the rest travel to Padli Fjord and
live with the families who had passed the winter there on Padloping. As
the floe edge approaches the land here, the country is favorable for
bear hunting, which is pursued in March and April. In June the natives
move up Padli Fjord to catch salmon, which are found in enormous numbers
at Padli. A&nbsp;few visit Agpan, where flocks of loons nest. The
natives who intend to return to Qivitung in summer leave about the end
of May or the beginning of June.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page442" id =
"page442">442</a></span>
<p>Those who remain at Qivitung during the winter go sealing in the bay
east of the peninsula and subsist upon the product of this occupation,
as well as on the walrus meat which was stored up in the summer and
autumn. A&nbsp;few leave Qivitung after the consolidation of the floe
and settle on Nanuqtaqdjung, an island in Home Bay, near the northern
point of Qeqertalukdjuaq.</p>

<p>In the winter the Akudnirmiut of Niaqonaujang generally remove to
Ipiutelling, on the southern shore of Koukteling, and in May go farther
south, to the island Avaudjelling. In the spring they go bear hunting on
Koukteling and the peninsula of Niaqonaujang, where the she bears dig
holes in the snow banks, in which they whelp.</p>

<p>Though the isthmuses are of great value in facilitating the
intercourse between the separate settlements of Cumberland Sound and
Davis Strait, as their headlands are washed by water, they are not
indispensable for the tribes of Davis Strait, for the ice is passable at
all points. The low peninsulas are crossed by the natives in their
travels in preference to rounding their headlands. Thus they not only
shorten their journey, but they avoid the rough ice often found off the
points.</p>

<p>For example, a pass leads from the western bay of Padli Fjord to
Kangertloaping, and another from Tessiujang, near Qivitung, across the
narrow and low isthmus into Home Bay. Similar passes are used in
crossing Koukteling, the peninsulas of Niaqonaujang, Aqojang, and
Aqojartung.</p>

<p>At Niaqonaujang I reached the limit of my travels and have only to
add reports which I obtained from other tribes and in other settlements.
River Clyde and Aqbirtijung are not always inhabited, but are visited at
irregular intervals by the Akudnirmiut, the same who usually stay at
Niaqonaujang. It is probable that Aqbirtijung and Kangertlualung are
sometimes visited by the Tununirmiut of Pond Bay.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_aggomiut" id = "tribes_baffin_aggomiut">The
Aggomiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>I can say but little about the two subtribes of the Aggomiut (the
Tununirmiut and the Tununirusirmiut), as the reports are scanty and the
chart of the region is too incorrect to convey any exact information.
A&nbsp;few statements may be derived from the Eskimo charts published by
Hall (II,&nbsp;pp.&nbsp;356 and 370). It appears that the natives winter
near the entrance of Navy Board Inlet and in the back of Eclipse Sound.
Settlements of the Tununirusirmiut at the western entrance of Admiralty
Inlet and near its head are mentioned by Hall. Besides seals these
natives also pursue the white whales and narwhals which frequent the
sound. In summer the Tununirmiut live at the entrance of Pond Bay.</p>

<p>Although I am not informed as to the position of the settlements, and
for this reason am unable to judge of the details of the life of the
Aggomiut, I&nbsp;can give the more general facts of their relations to
the neighboring tribes. Of the greatest importance is their connection
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page443" id =
"page443">443</a></span>
with the Iglulirmiut, for through them a regular intercourse is kept up
between the continent of America and the eastern shore of Baffin Land.
One road leads through Kangertlukdjuaq, a&nbsp;fjord east of Parry’s
Murray Maxwell Inlet, to the head of Anaulereëling. I&nbsp;received a
detailed description of this road from a native whom I met at
Niaqonaujang. Hall’s statement that this way leads to Pond Bay is very
likely erroneous, as the natives probably said that it led to Tununirn,
which comprises the whole district of Eclipse Sound and the region east
of it. It is possible that another road leads to Eχaluin, a&nbsp;fjord
of Eclipse Sound. Another route which is often used leads from
Kangertlung, Parry’s Gifford River, to Angmang, and farther west to
Tununirusirn. This route has already been described by Parry, who
attempted to reach the north shore of Baffin Land by it
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;449). Parry’s description was confirmed in 1869 by
Hall (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;356). I&nbsp;am somewhat doubtful whether Fury
and Hecla Strait, which is often filled with rough ice, can be passed
regularly, and whether a route leading to Tununirusirn follows the shore
of the Gulf of Boothia, as stated by some of the natives of Davis
Strait. This uncertainty did not occur to me until after I had read
Parry’s description. Communication between Tununirn and Tununirusirn is
by way of the isthmus between Kangertlung and Navy Board Inlet.</p>

<p>The journeys of the Aggomiut are not at all confined to Baffin Land.
In favorable winters they cross Lancaster Sound, passing the small
island Uglirn, and winter on the eastern half of Tudjan (North Devon).
While here they keep up some intercourse with the inhabitants of
Umingman Nuna (Ellesmere Land).</p>

<p>It is said that they cross the ice covered island on sledges. In four
days they reach the northern shore, whence a long, narrow peninsula,
Nedlung, stretches toward Ellesmere Land. Through the narrow passage
which separates Tudjan from Nedlung runs a very swift tide which keeps
open a water hole throughout the winter. All around this place the ice
wastes quickly in the spring and a large basin is formed which abounds
with seals. Only that part of the peninsula which lies nearest North
Devon is high and steep, presenting a bold face. Farther north it is
rather low.</p>

<p>Having reached Umingman Nuna, the Eskimo who gave me this information
affirm that they fell in with a small tribe who resided on this shore.
Here they lived for some time, as there was an abundance of seals during
the whole year. Farther northwest is a large fjord, Kangertluksiaq, off
which an island is found, Qeqertakadlinang by name. The Eskimo do not
visit the land on the other side of this fjord, as bears are said to be
very numerous and large there. Though these migrations to Jones Sound do
not occur very frequently, they have by no means been discontinued. For
instance, a&nbsp;family which was well known to me has visited Smith
Sound, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page444" id =
"page444">444</a></span>
the father of some friends of a resident of Cumberland Sound returned
about fifteen years ago from a long stay on Tudjan and Nedlung.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_iglulirmiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_iglulirmiut">The Iglulirmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The last group of natives belonging to Baffin Land are those of
Iglulik. Our knowledge of this tribe is due to Parry and Hall. As soon
as the sea begins to freeze up, the natives gather on Iglulik, where
they hunt the walrus throughout the winter. According to the position of
the floe edge, Iglulik, Pingitkalik, or Uglit Islands are the favorite
settlements. Later in the winter, when new ice is frequently attached to
the floe, part of the families move to the ice northeast of Igluling,
where seals are caught with the harpoon. Another winter settlement seems
to be near Amitoq. In April young seals are hunted in the bays and
fjords, particularly in Hooper Inlet. According to Hall the western
coast of Melville Peninsula is sometimes visited during the winter for
walrusing and bear hunting (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;343). An overland route
leads to this district, crossing the long Grinnell Lake and Brevoort
River, thus named by Hall (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;342). As soon as the warm
season approaches the natives go deer hunting on Melville Peninsula or
more frequently on Baffin Land. From the reports of Parry and Hall and
from my own inquiries, there can be no doubt that they visit the eastern
shore of Fox Basin.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_pilingmiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_pilingmiut">The Pilingmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>Two tribes were settled on the eastern coast of Fox Basin, the
Pilingmiut and the Sagdlirmiut, who had but slight intercourse with the
Iglulirmiut. I&nbsp;heard both mentioned at times when traveling along
Davis Strait. According to my information I should say that Piling is
about 74° west and 69° north. From Parry’s reports it appears that the
intercourse between these tribes and Iglulik was not very active; for,
although he had staid two years at Aivillik and Iglulik, the Pilingmiut
when visiting the latter tribe did not know anything about this fact,
which was one of the greatest importance to all the natives
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;430). Sometimes the Talirpingmiut of Cumberland Sound
meet the Pilingmiut, for both tribes go deer hunting northwest of
Nettilling. I&nbsp;heard of one such meeting between hunting parties in
that district.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_baffin_sagdlirmiut" id =
"tribes_baffin_sagdlirmiut">The Sagdlirmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The information as to the Sagdlirmiut is yet more scanty than that
relating to the inhabitants of Piling. Parry learned that Sagdlirn is
about east-northeast of Iglulik (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;549). The description
which I received on Davis Strait confirms this opinion, for the
direction was denoted as qaningnang, i.e., east-northeast; besides,
Sagdlirn was described as a long and narrow island.</p>


<h4><a name = "tribes_hudson" id = "tribes_hudson">WESTERN SHORE OF
HUDSON BAY.</a></h4>

<p>A remarkable difference exists between the customs of the western
tribes who live on the continent of America and those of the tribes that
inhabit Baffin Land and Melville Peninsula. This is chiefly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page445" id =
"page445">445</a></span>
due to the difference in the nature of their territorial surroundings
and to the presence of the musk ox, which they frequently hunt. In
addition, the tribes of the continent do not hunt the seal in the
winter, laying up instead their supply of meat and blubber in the fall.
The information in regard to two of these tribes is quite complete, as
they have been visited by explorers frequently and at all seasons. The
two tribes referred to are the Aivillirmiut, of the northwestern part of
Hudson Bay, and the Netchillirmiut of Boothia Felix. Unfortunately the
information in respect to the others, the Kinipetu or Agutit, the
Sinimiut, Ugjulirmiut, and Ukusiksalirmiut, is less complete.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_hudson_aivillirmiut" id =
"tribes_hudson_aivillirmiut">The Aivillirmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>In order to describe the mode of life of the Aivillirmiut I shall
give an abstract of Dr. John Rae’s observations in 1846-’47 and
1854-’55, of C.&nbsp;F. Hall’s life with these natives from 1864 to
1869, and of Lieut. F.&nbsp;Schwatka’s residence among them from 1877 to
1879. A&nbsp;pretty correct idea of the migrations and favorite resorts
of this tribe at the different seasons may be obtained from the journals
of these travelers.</p>

<p>When Rae arrived in Repulse Bay in the latter part of July, 1846, he
met with twenty-six natives who were deer hunting among the numerous
lakes of Rae Isthmus (I,&nbsp;pp.&nbsp;35, 40,&nbsp;48). Another part of
the tribe had resorted to Akugdlit, where they hunted the musk ox near
Point Hargrave (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;49). Committee Bay (Akugdlit) was filled
with a heavy pack about that time, and the natives hunted walrus in
their kayaks (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;58). Wherever they killed a deer or musk
ox they made deposits of the meat and carefully put up the walrus
blubber in sealskin bags for use during the winter. When, about the end
of September, the deer were migrating southward and new ice was forming
on the lakes, the natives settled in the center of that part of the
country which had been their hunting ground during the summer, in order
to be near their depots. For this reason they were well scattered all
over the country, some establishing their tents on the lakes of the
isthmus, others staying on the shore of Repulse Bay, where large
deposits of deer meat and blubber had been made. During the winter most
of the natives gathered in one settlement east of Fort Hope (near
Aivillik), whence they started to bring in their deposits. About the
20th of February they scattered all over the bay (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;91),
but it is doubtful whether they did this in order to be nearer their
depots or to go sealing. In March the first deer of the season were
seen. (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;93), but it was not until April that larger herds
passed Repulse Bay on their migration northward (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;99). At
this time a small supply of trout was procured from Christie Lake, but
it was not sufficient for the support of the natives
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;99). Caches of venison were made and frequently visited
until late in June (p.&nbsp;166). The sealing had begun in the beginning
of May (p.&nbsp;135), when the first animals were seen basking on the
ice. But
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page446" id =
"page446">446</a></span>
the Eskimo were now almost independent of their old food supply. When
the salmon left the lakes and the deer were roaming among the hills the
time of plenty was at hand. The salmon creeks were visited, deer were
caught, and seals pursued on the ice (p.&nbsp;170). Although the first
deer were caught in traps in May, the principal season for deer hunting
opened after the breaking up of the ice, when they were easily taken
while crossing the lakes.</p>

<p>When Rae wintered the second time in Repulse Bay (1854-’55) he was
much surprised to find no natives there. They had wintered farther
south, and did not come to the bay until May, 1855, when they could
catch seals on the land ice. In 1864, when Hall arrived at Wager River,
Repulse Bay was again deserted. This year of Hall’s stay in Hudson Bay
is very instructive, as we learn from his account the particulars of the
migration of the Aivillirmiut from Nuvung to Repulse Bay. The following
facts are taken from his journal:</p>

<p>In June, 1865, a traveling party arrived in Repulse Bay (Hall II,
p.&nbsp;177), where numerous deer were met with. Their tents were
erected on Uglariaq, whence seals were pursued, and they began at once
to make blubber deposits (p.&nbsp;179). They were very eager to store as
much provision as possible, as there was no chance of obtaining a fresh
stock at Repulse Bay during the winter. Some of the party brought their
boats to the floe edge in order to follow the seal and walrus, which
were swimming in the water or lying on the drifting ice in great
numbers, while others preferred sledging on the land floe and shooting
the basking seals (p.&nbsp;181). After the breaking up of the ice,
whales were seen, and kayaks and boats were made ready for their
pursuit. In September most of the natives returned to North Pole Lake to
hunt deer at the lower narrows (p.&nbsp;202), where the meat was
deposited for winter use (p.&nbsp;204).</p>

<p>On the 19th of October the last deer was killed (p. 205), and most of
the natives returned to the bay. They located at Naujan, the men in the
party numbering 43 (p.&nbsp;216). During the winter no kind of hunt was
kept up, only a few salmon and trout being caught in the lakes
(p.&nbsp;210). Towards the latter part of March the settlement was
broken up and its members scattered for the purpose of hunting and
fishing (p.&nbsp;227). Salmon were caught in North Pole Lake and deer
shot in the narrow passes (p.&nbsp;227). The sealing did not begin until
the first of April (p.&nbsp;239). In the summer, deer, seal, walrus, and
salmon were caught in great abundance. In the following years the mode
of life was about the same, but it maybe remarked that in August the
natives lived at Pitiktaujang and afterwards went to Lyon Inlet
(Maluksilaq) to hunt deer (p.&nbsp;323). Part of them returned to
Repulse Bay, where walrus were caught on the drifting ice during
September. In the ensuing winter (1867-’68) 55 natives had gathered in a
village about twenty miles east of Fort Hope (p.&nbsp;333), where they
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page447" id =
"page447">447</a></span>
lived on the stores deposited during the preceding summer. After the
breaking up of the ice they succeeded in killing several whales, which
afforded an ample supply of meat and blubber (p.&nbsp;363).
Subsequently, they hunted deer west of Repulse Bay (p.&nbsp;364) and
near Lyon Inlet, where probably the greater part of the families had
staid since the previous year.</p>

<p>In November, Hall found near the head of this inlet a number of
natives who came to Repulse Bay towards the end of the year, having
heard that a whale had been taken there. By this addition the village of
Repulse Bay suddenly increased in population to 120 inhabitants
(p.&nbsp;369). This was the only winter in which the natives, began
sealing in January (p.&nbsp;371). In March they built their huts upon
the ice and scattered early in the spring for sealing and catching
salmon.</p>

<p>From these reports and some more general accounts of these travelers,
an idea can be formed of the mode of life of this part of the
Aivillirmiut during the different seasons. In the spring, when the seals
commence to bask upon the ice, the tents are established on the floe of
Repulse Bay, the large winter settlements being broken up into a number
of smaller ones. During this season they begin to store away blubber,
which is carefully put into sealskin bags. Besides, reindeer are killed
in the deer passes. In July a great number of the natives leave the ice
and resort to the salmon rivers, where an abundant supply of food is
secured, but the sealing is also continued until the breaking up of the
ice. At this time of the year (i.e., in August), walrus and seal are
taken in large numbers, and thus an ample stock of provisions for winter
use is collected. In some seasons a few whales are caught and stored
away at once. In September, most of the natives move to the lakes or
rivers, particularly North Pole Lake, to hunt deer as well as the musk
ox on the hills. Other favorite localities for deer hunting are west of
Repulse Bay or near Lyon Inlet. Large deposits of venison are made, and
when the deer go south the natives settle in the center of their
summer’s hunting ground, building their snow houses on the lakes in
order to have a supply of water near at hand. About January most of them
gather in one settlement, which is established at Uglariaq, Naujan, or
Inugsulik. Those who come from Lyon Inlet do not always join the Repulse
Bay tribe, but may be identical with Parry’s Winter Island Eskimo, who
move to the bay south of Lyon Inlet in winter. They go sealing in winter
only in case of need, for the hunt seems to be unproductive, and they
subsist on the stores deposited during the preceding summer. Towards the
latter half of March the settlements are broken up and some of the
natives go to the lakes to fish for trout and salmon, while others begin
the sealing.</p>

<p>Another winter station of the Aivillirmiut is Akugdlit, which,
however, has never been as important as Aivillik itself. Rae found
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page448" id =
"page448">448</a></span>
some families here in August, 1846. They hunted the musk ox on the
western shore of the bay, and later in the season, upon the pack ice
which filled the sea, they hunted the walrus (Rae I, p.&nbsp;58). They
reported that the bay was very unfavorable for any kind of chase, as it
is usually filled with closely packed ice, which prevents the visits of
animals and endangers the boats of the natives (p.&nbsp;49). In July the
salmon creeks of Akugdlit (Committee Bay) were visited by these
families, who extended their hunting ground from Colville Bay to the
most northern parts of Melville Peninsula (p.&nbsp;145). According to
Hall a number of families live here at times. They were in the habit of
staying at Repulse Bay during the early part of the summer and went to
Akugdlit in the autumn to hunt the musk ox and deer. In the winter they
transferred their deposits of blubber from Aivillik across the lakes to
their settlement. Probably these families returned to Repulse Bay about
the first of March, at which time their deposits were always exhausted
(Hall II, p.&nbsp;383). In some seasons the natives journey much farther
south, that is, to the country between Cape Fullerton and Wager River.
Klutschak’s report upon this subject, which is extracted from his
observations during Schwatka’s search for the Franklin records, will be
found tolerably correct (Deutsche Rundschau für Geographie und
Statistik, III, 1881, p.&nbsp;422). The report contains the following
statement:</p>

<p class = "quote">
In the spring of every year these Eskimo live on the land floe of Hudson
Bay, at some distance from the point where the tides and winds carry the
pack ice past the shore. Here is the favorite feeding place of the
walrus, and the Eskimo confine themselves to the pursuit of this animal.
They settle near one of the numerous islands situated near the
shore.</p>

<p>Later in the season they live in tents, and the hunting of seals and
walrus is continued as long as the presence of ice permits. The greater
part of the Aivillirmiut live near Depot Island (Pikiulaq). Here, on
Cape Fullerton, and near the northern entrance of Chesterfield Inlet,
the natives deposit their stores for winter use. As soon as the ice is
gone they resort to the mainland, where deer, which descend to the shore
at this season, are hunted. When the snow begins to cover the country
they move inland, where they continue the deer hunt. In October they
settle near a deer pass or a lake which is crossed by the herds
migrating southward. In December all the deer have left the country and
the natives live upon the stores deposited in the fall. Towards the
beginning of the new year part of them return to the sea and live upon
the deposits of walrus meat or disperse over the land floe, where seals
are killed in their breathing holes. Another part take to the hills near
Chesterfield Inlet and Wager River, a&nbsp;favorite feeding ground for
the musk ox. They only return to the bay in March or April, to hunt
seals until the breaking up of the ice. If the supplies of walrus meat
are very abundant the Eskimo gather in one large settlement.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page449" id =
"page449">449</a></span>
<p>It appears from Klutschak’s own journal that this report is not quite
complete, and I shall therefore add those of his own observations which
seem to be important:</p>

<p>The natives who had hunted deer in the fall returned in December to
Depot Island, where ten inhabitants lived at that time. They hunted
walrus at the edge of the floe during the whole winter, but did not
exclusively use their old stores (Klutschak, p.&nbsp;32). In summer
whales were hunted by means of kayaks, the blubber and meat being
immediately stored for future use <ins class = "correction" title =
"opening ( missing">(p.</ins>&nbsp;269). It is interesting to learn that
a single family spent a whole year in the interior of the country, about
two or three days’ journey west of Depot Island, living on the flesh of
the musk ox most of the time (p.&nbsp;196). He does not say what kind of
fuel they used.</p>

<p>In Klutschak’s chart of Hudson Bay, which is published with his
essay, a&nbsp;winter settlement is marked on Wager River, where the
natives probably lived on seals caught in the breathing holes.</p>

<p>The mode of life of this tribe, as observed by Hall during his stay
among them in 1864, differs in some material points from Klutschak’s
account. It is particularly important that Hall found them at Wager
River.</p>

<p>About forty Eskimo are said to have lived in Nuvung during that year,
while others were at Depot Island. Large depots of deer meat were
scattered over the country around the settlement (Hall II, p.&nbsp;76)
and were brought in by the natives one by one. In the middle of
November, after having finished the work of currying their deerskins,
they commenced the walrus hunt, but meantime they frequently fed on deer
meat from their depots (Hall II, pp.&nbsp;102, 128, 132, 133). Towards
the end of February they commenced to disperse, at first moving
southward in order to be nearer the floe edge (p.&nbsp;144). In the
beginning of March an advance party of natives moved to Wager River,
where they intended to catch salmon through the ice and to visit depots
in that part of the country (p.&nbsp;149). In April all the former
inhabitants of Nuvung had settled on the ice of Wager River, where
salmon in moderate numbers were caught (p.&nbsp;164), but the main
subsistence was the seals, which were at first watched for at the
breathing holes, while later on they were killed when basking on the
ice.</p>

<p>As a summary of the foregoing statements, we may say that the five
principal settlements of the Aivillirmiut are Pikiulaq (Depot Island),
Nuvung and Ukusiksalik (Wager River), Aivillik (Repulse Bay), Akugdlit
(Committee Bay), and Maluksilaq (Lyon Inlet). They may be divided into
two groups, the former comprising the southern settlements, the latter
the northern ones. Every one of these settlements has certain well known
sites, which are frequented at the proper seasons.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page450" id =
"page450">450</a></span>
<p>It yet remains to describe the roads which are used in the
intercourse between these settlements. From Pikiulaq to Nuvung the
natives travel by means of sledges. In the winter of 1864-’65 two
journeys were made, the first in December, the latter in January.
Besides, boats are used in traveling along the shore in summer. Sledge
journeys from Nuvung to Ukusiksalik cannot be accomplished on the ice,
as in the entrance of the bay large water holes are formed. The sledges
follow a chain of long, narrow lakes beginning near Nuvung and running
almost parallel with the coast through a deep gorge. The bay is but a
short distance beyond this gorge. I&nbsp;am not acquainted with the
sledge road from Nuvung to Aivillik. Rae was visited at Fort Hope by a
number of Eskimo, who came by sledges from Nuvung in June
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;169). Hall traveled with the natives in boats, passing
the narrows and following the edge of the land ice, while the rest of
the families sledged on the shore or on the land ice
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;177). The principal road across Rae Isthmus leads over
North Pole Lake and is described by Rae and Hall. The latter accompanied
the natives on two sledge roads, the one leading from Sagdlua, in
Haviland Bay, to Qariaq, in Lyon Inlet, the other crossing the land
farther south. I&nbsp;am not sure whether a road leading from Nebarvik
to Committee Bay connects Maluksilaq with Akugdlit. It is doubtful
whether the coast between Aivillik and Gore Bay is visited by the
natives.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the Aivillirmiut very rarely go to Southampton
Island, though they are sometimes carried across Frozen Strait or Rowe’s
Welcome by drifting ice. Scarcely ever of their own accord do they visit
the island, which they call Sagdlirn. They know that it is inhabited,
but have very little intercourse with its people.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_hudson_kinipetu" id = "tribes_hudson_kinipetu">The
Kinipetu or Agutit.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The reports upon the Kinipetu or Agutit of Chesterfield Inlet are
very scanty as compared with those of the beforementioned tribe. All
authors agree that they differ materially in their habits from the
Aivillirmiut, and it has often been affirmed that they scarcely ever
descend to the sea. As there is, however, no other tribe mentioned south
of the Aivillirmiut besides this one and as in every voyage to these
shores, even far south of Chesterfield Inlet, Eskimo are met with who
frequently visit Fort Churchill, the most northern station of the Hudson
Bay Company, there can be no doubt that they also visit the shore and
the islands and hunt seals. Probably the greater part of the tribe live
inland from July to March, hunting deer and the musk ox, and in winter
only descend to the sea in order to procure blubber and sealskins during
the season in which these are most easily obtained. It may be that
another part stay near the head of Chesterfield Inlet all the year round
or remain in the hilly country between the deep gulf and Back River
hunting the musk ox. According to all reports, they are rather
independent of the hunt of sea animals, and they do not even use their
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page451" id =
"page451">451</a></span>
skins for garments (Klutschak, Deutsche Rundschau für Geographie und
Statistik, III, p.&nbsp;419). For this reason they would afford
interesting material for investigation, and it is unfortunate that no
trustworthy accounts of the tribe exist. Back, on his journey to the
shores of the Arctic Ocean, found traces of the Eskimo on the lakes of
Back River, ample proof that they were in the habit of visiting this
region every summer. He found the first traces near 107° west longitude,
and farther down, at the mouth of Baillie River. He did not see the
natives whom Anderson and Stewart met in the summer of 1855 near
McKinley River and later between Pelly and Garry Lakes. Their clothing
and even the covers of their kayaks were made of deer and musk ox skins.
They observed among these natives such articles of European make as the
Hudson Bay Company used for barter and which were traded to the most
southern Eskimo tribes of Hudson Bay. Therefore it is likely that these
natives belonged to Chesterfield Inlet. This opinion is supported by
Klutschak’s remark that a native of the mouth of Back River knew an
overland route leading from the lakes at its upper course to
Chesterfield Inlet.</p>

"tribes_hudson_sagdlirmiut">The Sagdlirmiut of Southampton
Island.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the Hudson Bay Eskimo I may mention the
inhabitants of Southampton Island, a&nbsp;tribe which is almost unknown
and the only record of which was obtained by Captain Lyon during the few
hours which he passed among them in 1824 (Attempt to reach Repulse Bay,
p.&nbsp;54). In August he found a few families on the island south of
Cape Pembroke, who were living upon salmon which had been deposited in
stone caches and who had tents made of sealskins. A&nbsp;winter house
was found at the same point. About 1865 an American whaling vessel found
some natives on Manico Point living in five tents. Even then they had
scarcely any iron, but used the old stone implements; this proves the
want of all communication with the natives of the mainland. Parry found
traces of Eskimo in York Bay and they have been seen on many other parts
of the island. The Hudson Bay tribes call this tribe the Sagdlirmiut,
i.e., the inhabitants of Sagdlirn, and their knowledge about them is
very scanty, as they meet very rarely and by chance only.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_hudson_sinimiut" id = "tribes_hudson_sinimiut">The
Sinimiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>Northwest of Hudson Bay we find a tribe in Pelly Bay. The reports
upon it are very scanty and it is difficult to find out the extent of
the district which is occupied by it. Ross did not fall in with the
tribe, and in the accounts of the Netchillirmiut on their journey to
Repulse Bay no mention is made of an intervening tribe
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;263). In April, 1847, Rae found signs of the tribe
near Helen Island, in Pelly Bay (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;113). There was an
abundance of seals on the ice all around the islands (p.&nbsp;111), but
besides these they had large stocks of dried musk ox and salmon
(p.&nbsp;124). On his second journey he found their winter habitation on
Barrow and Cameroon
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page452" id =
"page452">452</a></span>
Lakes (II,&nbsp;p. 938), and on the 20th of April he met with seventeen
natives on the mainland west of Augustus Island, among whom were five
women. In traveling farther west he fell in with a native who had been
hunting the musk ox. On the 17th of May he found twelve natives settled
in the same place and living on seal (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;842).</p>

<p>Hall met with this tribe twice, in 1866 and in 1869. On the 28th of
April, in his first attempt to reach King William Land, he found the
Sinimiut settled near Cape Beaufort, in Committee Bay, where they were
probably sealing (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;255). No further account of this
meeting is found except the remark that these natives were on their way
to Repulse Bay (p.&nbsp;259). Therefore it is rather doubtful whether
the eastern shore of Simpson Peninsula belongs to their customary
district. In April, 1869, on his second visit to Pelly Bay, Hall found
their deserted winter huts on Cameroon Lake (p.&nbsp;386). In the early
part of the spring they had lived on the ice south of Augustus Island,
the only place where seals could be caught, as the rest of the bay was
filled with heavy floes which had been carried south by the northerly
winds prevailing during the preceding fall. The natives themselves were
met with on the mainland west of Augustus Island, where they were
hunting the musk ox. When Hall crossed the bay in the first days of June
the natives had changed neither their place nor their mode of
subsistence.</p>

<p>There is a discrepancy in Nourse’s extract from Hall’s journal, for
he sometimes refers to the Pelly Bay natives as different from the
Sinimiut, while in other passages all the inhabitants of the bay are
comprised in the latter term. I&nbsp;think this discrepancy is
occasioned by the fact that a number of Aivillirmiut had settled in
Pelly Bay and some others were related to natives of that locality; the
latter Nourse calls the Pelly Bay men, the rest the Sinimiut. The place
Sini itself, according to a statement of Hall, is near Cape Behrens, on
the northwestern shore of the bay.</p>

<p>As the winter huts of the Sinimiut have been found four times on the
lakes of the isthmus of Simpson Peninsula, we may suppose that they
generally spend the winter there, living on the stores deposited in the
preceding season and occasionally angling for trout and salmon (Rae I,
p.&nbsp;110) or killing a musk ox. In March they leave for the sea in
order to hunt seals and to secure a fresh supply of blubber for their
lamps. Their chief subsistence is the musk ox; besides, salmon are
caught in great numbers, for they live on dried fish until spring (Rae
I, p.&nbsp;124).</p>

<p>Following the shore westward we find the interesting tribes that
inhabit Boothia Felix, King William Land, and the mouth of Back River.
Among them the Netchillirmiut are the most important. Their favorite
hunting grounds seem to have
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page453" id =
"page453">453</a></span>
undergone a remarkable change since they were first visited by Ross in
1829. At that period their district occupied the southern part of
Boothia Felix, particularly the narrow isthmus and the adjoining parts
of both coasts. They were acquainted with Bellot Strait (Ikerasaq),
which they described as the way the Victory had to take in order to
effect a passage to the western sea. A&nbsp;part of the tribe was in the
habit of wintering on Owutta Island; they also probably visited the
eastern part of King William Land. The southwestern termination of their
district cannot be exactly defined, but from their description of the
land south of Lake Willerstedt it appears that they visited Shepherd
Bay; besides, I&nbsp;find that in June, 1831, a&nbsp;number of families
lived south of Netchillik, i.e., probably in Rae Strait or on Shepherd
Bay (Ross II, p.&nbsp;537).</p>

<p>So far as can be gathered from Ross’s account the tribe had three
winter settlements, one on the eastern shore of the Isthmus of Boothia,
another at Lake Netchillik, and the third on Owutta Island.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> As to the first
meeting of the natives with the Victory two contradictory accounts are
found. At first it is related (p.&nbsp;252) that they came from
Akugdlit, having been on the road ten days. Later, and this is more
probable, it is said that two natives had descried the ship in
September, 1829, when passing near Victoria Harbor (p.&nbsp;309). Being
in great fear, they had immediately traveled to Netchillik to
communicate with their countrymen. There they met with a woman who had
been on board of Parry’s ships, and she had induced all the natives, by
her stories, to be on the lookout for the Europeans. At the first
meeting, on the 9th of January, 1830, 31 men approached the ship. This
would answer to a population of about one hundred and twenty persons,
and it is quite unprecedented that such a party should travel for any
distance and even beyond the limitations of their own territory and of
their customary migrations. Probably a traveling party had joined the
Netchillirmiut, who had lived somewhere in Lord Mayor’s Bay, and they
all went to meet the ship.</p>

<p>From Ross we also learn that during January and February these
natives lived on seals, which were killed with harpoons (pp.&nbsp;250,
255, 259), but, in addition, they had deposits of venison, seal blubber,
and fish (pp.&nbsp;251, 262). Sometimes they went hunting the musk ox on
the mainland farther north, and a small party may have staid there
throughout the winter (p.&nbsp;265). In the first days of March they
began to scatter all over the ice (p.&nbsp;290), in order to have a
better chance of sealing and of catching young seals in the white coat
(pp.&nbsp;293, 295). The young sealing commenced about the 10th of
March. It is worth remarking that this is the only tribe on the
continent of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page454" id =
"page454">454</a></span>
America which pursues the young seal; they are enabled to do this by the
extent of the land floe in the large bays. In the last days of March
some of the natives started for Sarvaq and Netchillik to fetch their
kayaks (p.&nbsp;315), which they had left there the preceding season. As
they intended to hunt deer at the lakes farther north, they were obliged
to have their boats at hand at the breaking up of the ice. The further
the season advanced the more the settlements were broken up
(p.&nbsp;338), and towards the end of April the first families left for
Netchillik to join the other part of the tribe (p.&nbsp;323). At this
season the musk ox and the returning reindeer were frequently hunted
(pp.&nbsp;252, 335, 349). In the first days of May some of the natives
went to Netchillik (p.&nbsp;337), and another party followed a month
later (p.&nbsp;383). They stopped on Middle Lake for a short time to
fish for trout (p.&nbsp;384). A&nbsp;number of families remained near
the ship, sealing, catching salmon, and hunting the musk ox
(pp.&nbsp;436, 441, 450, 453) until the beginning of July, when the
fishing season ended and they went to the inland lakes to hunt deer and
fish for trout in the rapids between the lakes (p.&nbsp;450). In the
summer their principal fishing stations were Lindsay River and
Sarvaq.</p>

<p>The other part of the tribe which had lived at Lake Netchillik were
even more numerous than that of the coast, as 21 snow houses were found
which had been inhabited by them during the winter (p.&nbsp;389). The
number of inhabitants of this village was about one hundred and seventy,
and, since there were a few who lived on Owutta Island and yet others
who may have been scattered in different parts of the country, it is
probable that the whole tribe numbered 350 persons.</p>

<p>As they were seen only a few times by the expedition the reports are
rather incomplete. In the winter they lived on a plain, which was called
Okavit, on the eastern shore of Lake Netchillik (p.&nbsp;315). The exact
position cannot be learned from Ross’s journal. As some mention is made
of blubber deposits at Netchillik (p.&nbsp;388), it is probable that
they lived on stores deposited in summer. Toward the end of May and in
the beginning of June they were met with at Spence Bay and Josephine
Bay. One of their stations was on the island Inugsulik, near Padliaq,
the head of Spence Bay. Here their principal food was codfish, which
they caught in holes cut through the ice, while the sealing was there a
less important interest (pp.&nbsp;391, 426). The kayaks which were found
deposited on the west shore of Boothia as far as Josephine Bay proved
that they resorted to this region in the deer hunting season
(pp.&nbsp;406, 407). The families who had been at Owutta during the
winter of 1829-’30 were found in June, 1831, in Padliaq, whence they
crossed the isthmus and visited Tarionitjoq (p.&nbsp;431).</p>

<p>In 1830 no natives were seen after the usual time of their departure
for the interior of the country, and it was not until April, 1831, that
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page455" id =
"page455">455</a></span>
they were found again. They had wintered at Lake Avatutiaq, on the
eastern shore of Boothia (p.&nbsp;511), where they had lived on a large
stock of salmon caught in the fall (p.&nbsp;531) and on musk oxen which
were hunted during the entire year in the hilly country near the lakes.
Others had wintered farther south, on Lake Owen (p.&nbsp;524).
A&nbsp;portion of these Eskimo set out for Netchillik in April
(p.&nbsp;522), while the others remained in Tom’s Bay and subsisted upon
codfish, salmon, and seals (p.&nbsp;546).</p>

<p>In June another party left for Netchillik, whence some of the
natives, who had not seen the ship before, arrived at Victoria Harbor in
July, probably having heard of her new station at this place through the
returning families (p.&nbsp;577). In August the last of them left, going
west (p.&nbsp;592).</p>

<p>Though these reports are rather imperfect, they enable us to get a
fair idea of the mode of life of this tribe.</p>

<p>In the large bays on the eastern side of the isthmus the natives live
just as do the southern tribes of Baffin Land, pursuing the seal at its
breathing hole during the winter. Here, as everywhere else, the
settlements were broken up early in the spring. The fishing is commenced
remarkably early, while in the east scarcely any salmon are caught
before the breaking up of the lakes. West of Melville Peninsula the
fishing is commenced in March or even earlier. On Boothia the most
important means of subsistence for the natives is the codfish, on which
they live during the spring and probably during a part of the winter. It
is also an important article of food for the other tribes of this
region, while farther east it is of no importance. The salmon fisheries
of Boothia are very productive, of which Netchillik and Padliaq in
Josephine Bay, Stanley and Lord Lindsay Rivers, Qogulortung,
Angmalortuq, and Sarvaq may be considered the most important. Deer are
hunted while swimming across the numerous lakes of Boothia, and the musk
ox in the granite hills of its northern part. Here is also another
winter resort of the tribe, from which the island Tukia, north of Lake
Avatutiaq, is visited in summer, to collect pyrite or native iron
(p.&nbsp;362), which is used for kindling fire. The life of the western
part of the tribe, as far as we are acquainted with it, was described in
the foregoing paragraph.</p>

<p>Neither Dease and Simpson, who visited Castor and Pollux River in
1839, nor Rae, on his second voyage to Boothia, met the natives
themselves; the latter, however, saw their marks on the islands of
Acland Bay (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;840).</p>

<p>The next traveler who fell in with the tribe was M’Clintock, who
visited King William Land in search of the Franklin records. In
February, 1859, he met several families near Cape Adelaide
(p.&nbsp;230). They traveled during the spring all along the shore and
had been near Tasmania Islands in March and April. They were seen by him
on their return journey to Netchillik, near Cape Nicholas. They
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page456" id =
"page456">456</a></span>
traveled slowly south, hunting seals. They knew the coast as far as
Bellot Strait and were able to name every cape of this district.
A&nbsp;few families who had wintered in company with this party at Cape
Victoria had returned to Netchillik when the other parties started north
(p.&nbsp;253). On the 4th of May, twenty deserted snow huts were found
on the southwest point of Matty Island (p.&nbsp;257). From the direction
of the sledge tracks, M’Clintock concluded that the natives who had
formerly lived here had gone to Netchillik. On the 7th of May a
settlement of 30 or 40 individuals was found on the eastern coast of
King William Land (p.&nbsp;260). This party had not communicated with
the villages on the mainland of Boothia since the preceding fall <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘(p. 260.)’">(p.&nbsp;260).</ins></p>

<p>An interesting change in the territory which is inhabited by this
tribe has occurred since Ross’s visit to this country. In order to
describe it more fully, I&nbsp;must refer to the relations of the
Netchillirmiut to the Ugjulirmiut. At this early period the intercourse
between the tribes of Ugjulik and Netchillik was of little consequence.
No European had ever been in their districts, which included Adelaide
Peninsula and the southern shore of King William Land (Ross II,
p.&nbsp;317), but quite a number of persons were known to the
Netchillirmiut (p.&nbsp;357), who had met them in their trading
excursions. In addition to this, a&nbsp;young single man of Ugjulik had
been adopted by a Netchillirmio who lived on the eastern coast of King
William Land and on Owutta Island (p.&nbsp;355). When the Franklin
expedition perished on King William Land, in 1848, the Netchillirmiut
had not yet visited that part of the country. From Schwatka’s inquiries
we learn that the tribe that found Crozier and his fellow sufferers did
not extend its migrations beyond Adelaide Peninsula and the southern
shore of King William Land. In the summer of 1848 they attempted in vain
to cross Simpson Strait, and were compelled to stay on the island. They
traveled all over the country as far as Peel Inlet, opposite to Matty
Island (Gilder, p.&nbsp;91). Hence it is obvious that the
Netchillirmiut, up to the time of the Franklin catastrophe, lived in
their old territory, as the inhabitants of Boothia in 1859 had only
indirect news of the shipwreck.</p>

<p>When the Ugjulirmiut obtained an enormous stock of metals and wood by
the destruction of Franklin’s ships, the Netchillirmiut commenced to
visit King William Land, in order to partake also of these riches. Thus
they began, by degrees, to move westward, and became intermingled with
the Ugjulirmiut. Hall mentions quite a number of Boothians who had met
Ross on the eastern shore of the isthmus, though they were living on
King William Land at that time (Hall II, p.&nbsp;405). Besides,
according to all accounts, the number of women is much smaller among the
Netchillirmiut than that of men, and these are obliged to look for wives
among the neighboring tribes, particularly among the Ugjulirmiut. As
these do not differ in the fashion
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page457" id =
"page457">457</a></span>
of their clothing and tattooing from the Netchillirmiut, it is scarcely
possible at the present time to separate the tribes. It is worth
remarking, however, that Gilder and Klutschak use both terms, and
therefore I conclude that the natives themselves are conscious of
belonging to different tribes.</p>

<p>Schwatka describes the limits of their territory as he learned them
from his observations in the summer of 1879 (Science, December 19, 1884,
p.&nbsp;543). He found them on the mainland opposite King William Land
and along the islands in the vicinity of Simpson Strait. They were most
numerous along the northern shores of Adelaide Peninsula, their villages
being scattered every few miles along the coast from Montreal Island to
Smith Point. On the chart accompanying this account the eastern shore of
the Back River estuary is included in the district inhabited by the
Netchillirmiut.</p>

<p>It is important to compare this description with the observations
which were made by Hall in 1869. He found the first traces of natives at
the very head of Shepherd Bay, where a sledge track was observed
(p.&nbsp;395). Near Point Acland several snow huts and a number of
natives were met with on the 30th of April (p.&nbsp;396). Farther west
he found a village on Point Booth (p.&nbsp;397), but the most
interesting fact is that in May, 1869, the party had fresh salmon from
Netchillik (p.&nbsp;400). This statement is decisive of the question
whether the Netchillirmiut still continued their visits to the isthmus
from which they take their name.</p>

<p>From Klutschak’s journal a few more details may be gathered. From it
we learn that in summer the Netchillirmiut scatter, and, while some go
sealing near Montreal Island (p.&nbsp;75), many others go inland to hunt
deer in the lakes of the peninsula and farther south (p.&nbsp;119).
A&nbsp;third party resort to King William Land, the southern shore of
which they frequent until September, while the more northern parts are
seldom visited (p.&nbsp;79). At this season they leave the island and
all return to Adelaide Peninsula (p.&nbsp;126). I&nbsp;suppose, however,
that this report does not refer to the whole tribe, but that another
party visited Shepherd Bay in winter. It seems to me very improbable
that in the interval between 1869 and 1879 a total change should have
occurred. In the spring they catch salmon, which are dried and stored to
be used in winter. Their stock of blubber and deer meat is sufficient to
last them during the greater part of the winter. At this season they
fish only in holes made through the ice. Important winter settlements
are at Point Richardson and at the outlet of Qimuqsuq (Sherman Inlet),
where all the deer needed are caught in the fall while they are crossing
the bay.</p>

<p>Although these statements do not altogether harmonize, it appears,
notwithstanding, that King William Land and Adelaide Peninsula, which
were not visited by the tribe in the early part of our century, became
its favorite hunting ground after the loss of the Franklin
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page458" id =
"page458">458</a></span>
expedition. Since that period the more northern parts of Boothia may
have been abandoned by the natives, though no certain proof of this can
be offered. Netchillik itself and the more southern parts were visited
up to 1869, and probably they are yet inhabited by the Eskimo. This
cannot be said with positiveness, however, for this part of the country
has not been visited since the times of Ross and M’Clintock. The
migration of the natives was caused, without doubt and as we have
already remarked, by the profusion of metals and wood obtained from the
wrecks and the starved traveling parties.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_boothia_ugjulirmiut" id =
"tribes_boothia_ugjulirmiut">The Ugjulirmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>Several important facts regarding the Ugjulirmiut are mentioned
above. Dease and Simpson found their first traces on the western shore
of Adelaide Peninsula. From Ross’s account (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;427) it
appears that their territory was the same at that period as it is now,
and M’Clintock’s meeting with them on the shore of King William Land may
be adduced as a proof of this. Their old country is now inhabited by
both Ugjulirmiut and Netchillirmiut. Therefore their mode of life is
identical and requires no comment. Visits to the northern parts of King
William Land have been very rare, but it was on one of these that
Franklin’s ships were discovered (Klutschak). They rarely went hunting
beyond Cape Herschel, but looked for driftwood on the northern shore of
the island.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_boothia_ukusiksalirmiut" id =
"tribes_boothia_ukusiksalirmiut">The Ukusiksalirmiut.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The last tribe of the Central Eskimo, the Ukusiksalirmiut, inhabit
the estuary of Back River. They were met by Back and by Anderson and
Stewart. Recently Schwatka and his party communicated with them on their
visit to King William Land. Klutschak affirms that they are the remains
of a strong tribe which formerly inhabited Adelaide Peninsula but was
supplanted by the Netchillirmiut and the Ugjulirmiut. Klutschak calls
them Ukusiksalik; Gilder, sometimes Ukusiksalik, sometimes Ugjulik. The
latter author relates that a single family living on Hayes River
(Kugnuaq) had formerly had its station on Adelaide Peninsula, but had
retired to this country when the warlike Netchillirmiut began to visit
King William Land and Adelaide Peninsula. Schwatka could identify the
same man with one of those whom Back had seen in the estuary of the
river in 1833 (Gilder, p.&nbsp;78). Therefore they must have lived in
this district a long time before the Netchillirmiut began to move
westward. According to Back the party with which he fell in did not know
the land beyond the estuary of Back River, which indicates that they
were neither from Ugjulik nor Netchillik. As the Ugjulirmiut lived on
Adelaide Peninsula when Ross wintered in Boothia, I&nbsp;do not consider
it probable that the Ukusiksalirmiut ever lived in that part of the
country, and I cannot agree with Klutschak. I&nbsp;may add Parry’s
remark, that beyond Ukusiksalik (Wager River) another Ukusiksalik (Back
River) was known to the natives of Winter Island.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page459" id =
"page459">459</a></span>
<p>The reports on their mode of life are very deficient. They were met
by Schwatka a little above the great bend of Hayes River in May, 1879;
he also met another party in December at the Dangerous Rapids of Back
River. Schwatka counted seven families at the former and nine at the
latter place. Their principal food consisted of fish, which are caught
in abundance in Back River (Klutschak, p.&nbsp;164). It is said that
they have no fuel during the winter. Undoubtedly they use some kind of
fuel, and I rather doubt the implication that they do not hunt seals at
all. The musk ox and fish, however, are their main food, according to
both Klutschak and Gilder. It is very remarkable that all the natives
west of Boothia depend much more on fish than do any other tribes of the
Central Eskimo.</p>

<p>A word in regard to the roads used in the intercourse between the
tribes. From Akugdlit a road leads over the lakes of Simpson Peninsula
to Pelly Bay. Rae and Hall traveled over it on their journeys to the
northwest and it was used by the Sinimiut when they visited Repulse Bay
in 1866. From Pelly Bay two roads lead to Netchillik and the estuary of
Back River, the one following the east shore of the Boothia, the other
running to Lake Simpson, whence the valley of Murchison River
facilitates the access to Inglis Bay. The Isthmus of Boothia is crossed
by the two chains of lakes discovered by Ross. In visiting the
northeastern part of the peninsula the natives ascend Stanley River and
cross the lakes farther north. Between Netchillik and Ugjulik the Eskimo
pass by Owutta Island to Peel Inlet, whence they travel overland to the
south shore of King William Land and cross Simpson Strait. Another road
leads from Cape Colville to Matheson Point, following the south shore of
King William Land. In traveling from Ugjulik to Back River they use
Sherman Inlet and the adjoining isthmus. It is probable that Back River
is visited by natives belonging to Wager River. The existence of a
communication between Back River and Chesterfield Inlet is proved by
Anderson and Stewart, who found Eskimo at Lake Garry, and by a remark of
Klutschak (p.&nbsp;170), who learned from a native of Back River that
Chesterfield Inlet could be reached from the upper part of that river.
It is quite probable that thus an immediate though limited intercourse
is kept up between the Kinipetu and the Ukusiksalirmiut.</p>

natives of Ellesmere Land.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>Last of all I have to mention the natives of Ellesmere Land and those
of North Greenland. Although the latter are not generally considered as
belonging to the central tribes, I&nbsp;find that their habits and their
implements resemble those of the Central Eskimo rather than those of the
Greenlanders,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page460" id =
"page460">460</a></span>
and therefore a brief mention of them will not be inappropriate. The
inhabitants of Umingman Nuna (Ellesmere Land) probably live on the
southern shore, near the western part of Jones Sound, and, according to
Bessel’s and my own inquiries, they travel all around this island,
passing by Hayes Sound.</p>

<h5><a name = "tribes_smith_greenland" id = "tribes_smith_greenland">The
North Greenlanders.&mdash;</a></h5>

<p>The North Greenlanders live in the sounds of the peninsula between
Melville Bay and Kane Basin, hunting seals on the smooth floes of the
bays and pursuing walrus at the floe edges. They make large deposits of
the blubber and meat obtained in the fall, on which they live during the
winter. They also pursue seals in winter with the harpoon. In summer
they hunt reindeer on the mountains adjoining the inland ice.</p>

<h3><a name = "geog" id = "geog">INFLUENCE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS
UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SETTLEMENTS.</a></h3>

<p>In considering the distribution of the tribes it is evident that they
are settled wherever extensive floes afford a good sealing ground during
the winter. The Sikosuilarmiut live on the large bay east of King Cape,
which is sheltered by numerous islands. The Akuliarmiut are settled near
Lesseps and North Bays. I&nbsp;am unable to say whether there is a floe
near the winter settlement of the Qaumauangmiut, as there are no reports
upon the subject. Probably ice is formed in the sound, which is
protected by the Middle Savage Islands, and besides it may be that the
natives move to North Bay. The important tribe of Nugumiut lives on
Frobisher Bay and the adjoining Grinnell and Field Bays. On the largest
floe of this part of the country, in Cumberland Sound, including Lake
Nettilling, the largest tribe is settled: the Oqomiut. On Davis Strait
ice floes are formed between Cape Mickleham and Cape Mercy, in Exeter
Sound, and between Okan and Bylot Island. The tribes are distributed
accordingly: the Saumingmiut of Ukiadliving, the inhabitants of
Qarmaqdjuin with their winter settlement in Exeter Sound, and the
Padlimiut and the Akudnirmiut farther north. The immense land floe of
Davis Strait is not so valuable a hunting ground for the Eskimo as
Cumberland Sound, the ice being very rough a few miles from the coast
and at some places even close inshore. When the sea begins to freeze in
the fall the newly formed ice is broken up by severe gales and by the
currents and is piled up into high hummocks before it consolidates. The
sealing on rough ice during the winter is very difficult and
unsuccessful, as it is hard to find the breathing holes and the
traveling is very laborious. It is only in the northern parts of Home
Bay and in the large fjords that smooth ice is formed. The settlements
of the natives are manifestly distributed in accordance with these
facts. In every place where smooth ice is formed we find that natives
either are settled or have been settled. Aqbirtijung, River Clyde,
Ijellirtung,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page461" id =
"page461">461</a></span>
Home Bay, Brodie Bay, Merchant Bay, and Padli are the only places along
the shore of Davis Strait where smooth ice occurs. On the long shores
between them, which are unsheltered from winds and currents, the ice is
always very hummocky, and, therefore, the natives do not settle upon
them in the winter. In the far north, extensive floes of smooth ice are
formed in Eclipse Sound and Admiralty Inlet.</p>

<p>Concerning the country farther west the reports are rather scanty.
The southwest shore of Baffin Land and the eastern entrance of Fury and
Hecla Strait are always frozen over and afford a good hunting ground. On
the mainland, the large floes of Repulse Bay and Wager River,
Chesterfield Inlet and the bights all around it, Pelly Bay and the
narrow bays adjoining Boothia Peninsula, and the mouth of Back River are
important places for the distribution of the Eskimo.</p>

<p>There are only a few districts where the proximity of open water
favors walrus hunting during the winter, and all of these have
neighboring floes on which seals may be hunted with the harpoon. These
places are Sikosuilaq, Akuliaq, Frobisher Bay, Iglulik, the west shore
of Hudson Bay, and Smith Sound. As to the remainder the Eskimo live
altogether independent of the open water during the winter.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, two conditions are required for winter
settlements, viz, the existence of an extensive floe and smooth ice.</p>

<p>The different mode of hunting in the spring causes a different
distribution of the settlements. During this season those regions which
had been deserted during the winter are most visited by the hunters. On
light dog sledges they travel over the rough ice and along the shores of
the fjords and islands. The natives who lived in large settlements
during the winter are spread over the whole country, in order that every
one may have a better chance of traveling over his own hunting ground.
In a few places the young sealing induces the Eskimo to leave the winter
settlements; in other places the kayaks are prepared for visiting the
floe edge, and bears and the returning birds are hunted.</p>

<p>Though the greater variety of food which is to be obtained and the
difference in the methods of hunting in the spring require the
dispersion over a wide area of the families which had kept together
during the winter, the selection of places for the new settlements
remains wholly dependent upon the state of the ice.</p>

<p>After the ice breaks up, the distribution of the deer regulates the
location of the summer settlements. While during the winter the state of
the ice is of decisive importance, the orography of the land comes now
into consideration.</p>

<p>Wherever deep valleys give access to an extensive area, wherever
practicable roads enable the natives to ascend the plateaus, summer
settlements are established. The heads of the fjords are favorite
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page462" id =
"page462">462</a></span>
places, as they abound with salmon. The adjoining valleys and the
peninsulas which they form give the best chances for a successful deer
hunt. These facts are most apparent on the coast of the steep highland
of Nugumiut, over which numerous herds of deer roam.</p>

<p>A great influence is also exerted by the extensive plains of the
western part of Baffin Land, which abound in deer. We observe that a
number of tribes visit these districts, though their winter stations are
at a great distance. The Akuliarmiut of Hudson Strait and the Nugumiut
travel to Lake Amaqdjuaq, the Oqomiut stay on Lake Nettilling, and the
Akudnirmiut visit Majoraridjen. In the same way all the tribes of Hudson
Bay visit the land farther west, which is frequented by herds of the
musk ox, and they go even as far as Back River. This important fact
shows the attraction which is exerted by a rich country on all the
tribes of the neighboring districts.</p>


<h3><a name = "trade" id = "trade">TRADE AND INTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE
TRIBES.</a></h3>

<p>In treating of the single tribes, the routes were mentioned which are
followed by the natives as they travel from shore to shore and from
settlement to settlement. These routes are established by tradition and
the Eskimo never stray from them. In order to obtain a more thorough
understanding of the migrations of single individuals and of families,
the relations between the tribes and the settlements must be
discussed.</p>

<p>By the lively intercourse which is always kept up between the
settlements, it cannot fail that marriages between members of different
tribes should be of frequent occurrence and that many ties of affinity
and consanguinity should thus be created. These relations, however, as
distances increase, quickly become less common. For instance, in
Cumberland Sound three people are found belonging to Tununirn, about ten
belonging to Akudnirn, and quite a number coming from Padli. Also, two
Sikosuilarmiut live there, a&nbsp;few natives of Akuliaq and Qaumauang,
and very many Nugumiut. Hall’s accounts concerning the Nugumiut and the
Aivillirmiut prove a similar proportion of strange natives among these
tribes. Every tribe may be said to bring together its immediate
neighbors, as it is closely related to them, while those which are
separated by the tribe itself are strangers to one another. The
importance of this mediate position is regulated by the strength of the
tribe, by the significance of the country in reference to its produce,
and by the routes crossing it.</p>

<p>Thus, the Sikosuilarmiut and the Nuratamiut are closely connected,
and may be considered as forming one group with the Akuliarmiut. The
Sikosuilarmiut have intercourse with the Igdlumiut, the inhabitants of
the northern shore of Labrador. According to Lucien M. Turner, three
tribes may be distinguished there as inhabiting the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page463" id =
"page463">463</a></span>
shores of Ungava Bay and the eastern shore of Hudson Bay. This report
differs somewhat from the accounts of the Moravian missionaries who have
intercourse with the inhabitants of Ungava Bay near Cape Chidleigh. From
their reports four tribes may be distinguished: the Kangivamiut of
George River, the Kouksoarmiut of Big River, the Ungavamiut of Hope
Advance Bay (which is properly named Ungava), and the Itivimiut of
Hudson Bay. I&nbsp;am rather undecided whether Ungava is a bay or a
large strait separating Cape Wolstenholme and the adjacent land from the
continent, as the name Ungava is also reported south of Cape
Wolstenholme. The inhabitants of this shore are the Itivimiut of the
Labrador Eskimo and the Igdlumiut of the natives of Baffin Land.
Probably the intercourse between Sikosuilaq and Cape Wolstenholme is of
no great importance. The Sikosuilarmiut visit Trinity Islands
(Nannuragassain) in skin boats to hunt walrus and cross by the three
islands Tudjaraaq´djung, Akugdlirn, and Tudjaqdjuara´lung to the
opposite shore of Hudson Strait. The passage across the strait is
considered very dangerous, and therefore is rarely undertaken. The
natives do not utter a single word during the long passage; they believe
a destructive gale might be conjured up if they did. Only once have
natives been met with on Salisbury Island (Lyon, Attempt to reach
Repulse Bay, p.&nbsp;128), but it is doubtful whether they belonged to
the northern or to the southern shore of the strait. As for the rest,
the passage is only known to me by reports I received in Cumberland
Sound, which were confirmed by the whalers visiting the northern shore
of Hudson Strait. I&nbsp;do not know whether any intercourse exists
between Sikosuilaq and Southampton Island. It is worth remarking that on
Mansfield Island numerous ruins of Eskimo habitations have been found
(Gordon, Report on the Hudson’s Bay Expedition, 1884, p.&nbsp;38).</p>

<p>The Qaumauangmiut are connected with the Nugumiut in the same manner
as with the Akuliarmiut, and many are said to winter near North Bay,
which is also visited by the Akuliarmiut. From Hall’s reports it would
appear that many are settled in Frobisher Bay.</p>

<p>At present the intercourse between the Nugumiut and the Oqomiut is of
no significance, as many years may pass without a journey being made
from one tribe to the other. Formerly, when many whalers visited
Cumberland Sound and Field Bay, a&nbsp;number of Nugumiut immigrated to
the sound, and consequently almost half of the Eskimo now settled on the
western shore of Cumberland Sound were born in Nugumiut or Ukadliq. At
the same time many Oqomiut settled among the Nugumiut. That period was
doubtless an exceptional one; at any rate, the long stretch of
uninhabited shore between the settlements of the two tribes is not
favorable to intimate intercourse. Indeed, even now the Nugumiut are
considered strangers in the sound, and, notwithstanding the existence of
many intermarriages between the tribes, a&nbsp;number of families are
not at all acquainted
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page464" id =
"page464">464</a></span>
with one another. It is remarkable that the number of natives born in
Nugumiut is much larger on the western shore than on the eastern. They
seem to have joined their nearest neighbors, the southern Talirpingmiut,
perhaps for the reason that in their district the geographic character
of the land is most similar to that of Frobisher Bay. The number of
Nugumiut settled among the inhabitants of Nettilling Fjord and among the
Kingnaitmiut is far less. Among the Saumingmiut there is no one who has
traveled beyond Naujateling, and in Padli or farther north there are
very few individuals who have been south of Cumberland Sound. It is only
by careful consideration of the birthplace of the different individuals
who are members of the settlements of Cumberland Sound that it is
possible at the present time to detect the former division of the
Oqomiut into subtribes. The inhabitants of the eastern shore are related
to the Padlimiut and the Akudnirmiut; those of the western shore, to the
Nugumiut. In 1840 a brisk intercourse existed between Padli and the
sound (Eenoolooapik, p.&nbsp;81), and probably sledges crossed the
peninsula every winter. Though the intercourse is not so intimate to-day
as it is between the settlements of the sound, it is yet active. The
Kingnaitmiut form the medium of the regular intercourse between Saumia
and Padli, while families removing to Akudnirn travel along the shore of
Davis Strait. Among the subtribes of the Oqomiut the Saumingmiut are
most nearly related to the Padlimiut and extend their migrations
farthest to the north.</p>

<p>The Akudnirmiut, who are closely connected with the Padlimiut, are
considered strangers by the Oqomiut. The intercourse between the
Akudnirmiut and the Aggomiut is not very frequent, and seems to be
maintained as irregularly as that between the Nugumiut and the
Oqomiut.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the northern sounds and of Fury and Hecla Strait
frequently visit one another. Parry mentions a number of journeys in
each direction (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;436). Hall found natives of Tununirn
and Tununirusirn settled in Iglulik (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;356).
I&nbsp;myself found two Iglulirmiut among the Akudnirmiut. The
intercourse seems to have been always very active, and consequently
those tribes may be considered as one group.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of North Devon belong to the Tununirusirmiut,
a&nbsp;few families of this tribe sometimes settling on the island and
after a few years’ absence returning to their former home.</p>

<p>From Parry’s, Hall’s, and Schwatka’s reports it appears that the
Aivillirmiut are closely related to the Iglulirmiut, while the Eskimo of
Chesterfield Inlet, the Agutit or Kinipetu, form a separate group.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that between the tribes of Hudson Bay and the more
western ones a deep distrust exists, which prevents a frequent and
unlimited intercourse. The Sinimiut and Netchillirmiut are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page465" id =
"page465">465</a></span>
feared by the Aivillirmiut, though intermarriages and removals from one
tribe to the other are not rare. No doubt they are less closely related
than are the neighboring tribes hitherto mentioned. Unfortunately, too
little is known of the western tribes to admit of a decided opinion
whether or not there exists an important difference in customs and
habits. The Sinimiut, the Netchillirmiut, and the Ugjulirmiut may be
comprised in one group, for they all hold frequent intercourse with one
another and the last two even inhabit the same region at the present
time. The change which the relations between these tribes have undergone
since 1833 has already been referred to, as has their intercourse with
the Ukusiksalirmiut. Schwatka (Science, Vol. IV, p.&nbsp;543) states
that they occasionally meet the Qidneliq of Coronation Bay, but that
both tribes distrust each other. Our knowledge about the migrations from
North Devon to Ellesmere Land and North Greenland is very scanty, but it
is necessary to mention its existence.</p>

<p>Between tribes that are strangers to one another ceremonies of
greeting are customary which are not adapted to facilitate intercourse.
The ceremonies will be described further on (see <a href =
"#page609">p.&nbsp;609</a>). For the present it will be sufficient to
say that duels, with varying details, are common between a stranger and
a man of the tribe, and these sometimes result in the death of the
former.</p>

<p>Among neighboring tribes these ceremonies are dispensed with, for
instance, between the Padlimiut and Oqomiut, Padlimiut and Akudnirmiut,
while a Nugumio or an Akudnirmio unknown in Oqo has there to go through
the whole of the performance. The exception in favor of the former
tribes is doubtless due to the frequent intermarriages with those
tribes, whereby a constant acquaintance is kept up.</p>

<p>Real wars or fights between settlements, I believe, have never
happened, but contests have always been confined to single families. The
last instance of a feud which has come to my knowledge occurred about
seventy years ago. At that time a great number of Eskimo lived at
Niutang, in Kingnait Fjord, and many men of this settlement had been
murdered by a Qinguamio of Anarnitung. For this reason the men of
Niutang united in a sledge journey to Anarnitung to revenge the death of
their companions. They hid themselves behind the ground ice and killed
the returning hunter with their arrows. All hostilities have probably
been of a similar character.</p>

<p>One tradition only refers to a real fight between the tribes. On the
steep island Sagdluaqdjung, near Naujateling, ruins of huts are found on
the level summit. They are said to have been built by Eskimo who lived
by the seashore and were attacked by a hostile tribe of inlanders. The
tradition says that they defended themselves with bows and arrows, and
with bowlders which they rolled down upon the enemy. The occurrence of
huts upon the top of an island is very unusual, and this tradition is
the only one referring to any kind of fights or wars. Even the tradition
of the expulsion of the Tornit a
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page466" id =
"page466">466</a></span>
fabulous tribe said to have lived with the Eskimo on these shores, does
not refer to a combat. The details of this tradition will be found in a
subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>I wish to state here that my inquiries and my understanding of the
facts as they have been reported by other travelers do not agree with
the opinions given by Klutschak (Deutsche Rundschau für Geographie und
Statistik, III, p.&nbsp;418), who claims for the Eskimo of the west
shore of Hudson Bay reservations which are limited by precise lines of
demarkation. In comparing this statement with his own and with Gilder’s
narratives I am led to believe that the relations between the tribes are
the same in these regions as they are farther east. This opinion is
strengthened by Dall’s remarks on the Alaska tribes (Science,
p.&nbsp;228, 1885).</p>

<p>The reasons for the frequent removals of individual Eskimo to strange
tribes are to be looked for in the customs of the natives. I&nbsp;can
only mention here that intermarriage, adoption, and the fear of blood
vengeance are the principal ones.</p>

<p>It is peculiar to the migratory habits of the Eskimo that almost
without exception the old man returns to the country of his youth, and
consequently by far the greater part of the old people live in their
native districts.</p>

<p>During the last decades the most important inducement to removals has
been the presence of the whalers in certain parts of the country. Since
the beginning of our century their fleets have visited the west shore of
Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, and thus European manufactures have found
their way to the inhospitable shores of the Arctic Sea. The most
valuable objects which were bartered were metals and wood. The value of
the former may be seen in its economical application for knives and
harpoon heads. By means of this trade the Akudnirmiut and the
Tununirmiut became far superior to the Oqomiut and the Iglulirmiut, with
whom they traded extensively in dogs, skins, &amp;c. The Akuliarmiut and
the Qaumauangmiut also enjoyed the advantages which accrued from trade
with the ships of the Hudson Bay Company.</p>

<p>When the whalers became better acquainted with the natives and the
peculiar jargon which is still in use was developed, the traffic became
very active, and reached its height after Cumberland Sound was
rediscovered by Penny. As soon as the whalers began to winter in the
sound and to employ the natives the latter received firearms and
European boats in exchange for their wares, and then their modes of
living became materially changed. The immense quantity of European
manufactured articles which thus came into the possession of the natives
induced the removal of many families to the favored region. Particularly
did the Nugumiut and the Akudnirmiut migrate during that period. When in
the course of time the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page467" id =
"page467">467</a></span>
Bay of Nugumiut was visited by the whalers removals of members of this
tribe became less frequent.</p>

<p>After the Eskimo had become acquainted with the advantages of
firearms the natives of Davis Strait also began to trade bearskins for
guns and ammunition, having learned how highly they were prized in
Cumberland Sound. Besides, they received, in exchange for seals and
walrus blubber put up for the whalers, tobacco, pipes, coffee, boxes,
&amp;c. In a similar way the Saumingmiut barter with the whalers of
Cumberland Sound, whom they visit during the winter, carrying heavy
loads of bearskins to the stations.</p>

<p>A brief sketch of the way in which the whaling and the trade with the
Eskimo in Cumberland Sound are carried on may be of interest at this
point. Two of the whaling stations are still kept up. They are situated
on Qeqerten, the settlement of the Kingnaitmiut. When the Eskimo who
have spent the summer inland return at the beginning of October they
eagerly offer their services at the stations, for they receive in
payment for a half year’s work a gun, a&nbsp;harmonium or something of
that nature, and a ration of provisions for their families, with tobacco
every week. Every Saturday the women come into the house of the station,
at the blowing of the horn, to receive their bread, coffee, sirup, and
the precious tobacco. In return the Eskimo is expected to deliver in the
kitchen of the station a piece of every seal he catches.</p>

<p>The time for the fall fishing commences as soon as the ice begins to
form. If the weather, which is generally stormy, permits it, the boats
leave the harbor to look out for the whales which pass along the east
shore of the sound toward the north. During the last few years the catch
has been very unprofitable, only a few whales having been seen. As the
ice forms quickly the boats must be brought back about the end of
October or the beginning of November. Since the whale fishery has become
unprofitable the stations have followed the business of collecting seal
blubber and skins, which they buy from the Eskimo. (See Appendix,
<a href = "#app1">Note&nbsp;1</a>.)</p>

<p>A lively traffic springs up as soon as the ice becomes strong enough
to allow sledges to pass from shore to shore. The sledges of the
stations are sent from one settlement to another to exchange tobacco,
matches, coffee, bread, &amp;c. for skins and the spare blubber which
the Eskimo have carefully saved up. On the other hand, those natives who
require useful articles, such as cooking pots, lamps, &amp;c., collect
quantities of hides and blubber and go to Qeqerten to supply their
wants. The winter passes quickly amid the stir of business, till
everything comes to a stop at the end of March, when the young sealing
season fairly opens.</p>

<p>When the sun has reached such a height that the snow begins to melt
in favored spots, a&nbsp;new life begins at the stations. The skins
which have been collected in the winter and become frozen are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page468" id =
"page468">468</a></span>
brought out of the store room and exposed to the sun’s rays. Some of the
women busy themselves, with their crescent shaped knives, in cutting the
blubber from the skins and putting it away in casks. Others clean and
salt the skins, which are likewise packed away. The men also find enough
work to do after the young sealing is over, for the whale boats must be
got ready for the spring fishing. Strangers whose services have been
engaged by the station for the next few months arrive daily with their
families and all their goods to take up their abode on Qeqerten. The
boats are dug out of the deep snow, the oars and sails are looked after,
the harpoons are cleaned up and sharpened, and everything is in busy
preparation. The boats are made as comfortable as possible with awnings
and level floors, for the crews are not to come to the shore for about
six weeks.</p>

<p>By the beginning of May, the arrangements having been completed, the
boats are put upon the sledges, which, under the direction of native
drivers, are drawn by dog teams, with their crews, to the floe edge. The
sledges being heavily laden and food for the dogs having to be provided
by hunting, each day’s stage is rather short. Arriving at the floe edge
the sledges are unloaded and the boats are launched. Seals and birds of
all kinds are now found in profusion and the chase is opened without
delay upon everything that is useful and can be shot. Sledges are
regularly sent back to Qeqerten with skins and meat for the families of
the Eskimo, while the blubber is packed in casks, which are kept ready
on the spot.</p>

<p>The most important object of the expedition is the whale. Harpoons
and lines are always in readiness for the contest with the mighty
monster. The boats return to the north with the breaking up of the ice
and the fishing ends in July. The Eskimo are paid off and dismissed and
resume their reindeer hunting, while the whites are glad to enjoy some
rest after the weeks of exhausting labor.</p>

<p>The constant contact between the Eskimo and the whalers has effected
a perfect revolution in the trade between the Eskimo tribes. As the
whale catch in Cumberland Sound has fallen off during the past fifteen
years, a&nbsp;remigration of the population of Davis Strait has
occurred, ships visiting these shores every fall and a regular traffic
being kept up. Therefore many Oqomiut now travel as far as Qivitung in
order to trade there. As Nugumiut is still frequently visited by
whalers, there is no inducement for the inhabitants to leave their
country.</p>

<p>Within a few years the Akuliarmiut also have become amply provided
with firearms and European products in general by means of a new whaling
station which has been established in their vicinity.</p>

<p>As to the Iglulirmiut, the importation of European manufactures at
Pond Bay makes the trade with that region even more important than
formerly.</p>

<p>The Aivillirmiut and the Kinipetu have immediate intercourse
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page469" id =
"page469">469</a></span>
with the whalers frequenting the western shore of Hudson Bay. Besides,
the southern tribes trade with the stations of the Hudson Bay
Company.</p>

<p>The more western tribes of Boothia and its environs are dependent on
the mediation of the Aivillirmiut for their supply of goods, as they
themselves have no chance of communicating with the whites.</p>

<p>Finally, I shall describe the old trading routes which existed
between these tribes before matters were totally changed by the
influence of the Europeans. Two desiderata formed the principal
inducement to long journeys, which sometimes lasted even several years:
wood and soapstone. The shores of Davis Strait and Cumberland Sound are
almost destitute of driftwood, and consequently the natives were obliged
to visit distant regions to obtain that necessary material. Tudjaqdjuaq
in particular was the objective point of their expeditions. Their boats
took a southerly course, and, as the wood was gathered, a&nbsp;portion
of it was immediately manufactured into boat ribs and sledge runners,
which were carried back on the return journey; another portion was used
for bows, though these were also made of deer’s horns ingeniously lashed
together. A&nbsp;portion of the trade in wood seems to have been in the
hands of the Nugumiut, who collected it on Tudjaqdjuaq and took it
north. Another necessary and important article of trade, soapstone, is
manufactured into lamps and pots. It is found in a few places only, and
very rarely in pieces large enough for the manufacture of the articles
named. Among the places visited by the natives for the purpose of
obtaining it may be mentioned Kautaq, east of Naujateling; Qeqertelung,
near the former place; Qarmaqdjuin (Exeter Bay), and Committee Bay. The
visitors come from every part of the country, the soapstone being dug or
“traded” from the rocks by depositing some trifles in exchange. In
addition to wood and soapstone, metals, which were extremely rare in old
times, have formed an important object of trade. They were brought to
Baffin Bay either by the Aivillirmiut, who had obtained them from the
Hudson Bay Company and the Kinipetu, or by the Akuliarmiut. Even when
Frobisher visited the Nugumiut in 1577 he found them in possession of
some iron (Frobisher).</p>

<p>The occurrence of flint, which was the material for arrowheads, may
have given some importance to places where it occurs. Formerly an
important trade existed between the Netchillirmiut and the neighboring
tribes. As the district of the former is destitute of driftwood and
potstone they are compelled to buy both articles from their neighbors.
In Ross’s time they got the necessary wood from Ugjulik, the potstone
from Aivillik. They exchanged these articles for native iron
(or&nbsp;pyrite), which they found on the eastern shore of Boothia and
which was used for striking fire. After having collected a sufficient
stock of it during several years, they traveled to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page470" id =
"page470">470</a></span>
the neighboring tribes. For reasons which have been mentioned this trade
is now essentially changed. According to Schwatka there is a mutual
distrust between the Ugjulirmiut and the Netchillirmiut on one side and
the Qidnelik on the other, for which reason the intercourse between
these tribes is very limited.</p>

</div>

<p>In the winter it takes to the smooth parts of the floe a few miles
from the coast, where it scratches breathing holes through the ice, in
which it rises to blow. It shuns hummocky ice and floes of more than one
year’s age. Wherever the edge of the ice is at a great distance from the
settlements, the only way of procuring seals is by watching for them at
these holes. For the pursuit a light harpoon is used, called unang. The
shape of this weapon has been somewhat changed since the introduction of
rod iron. Formerly it consisted of a shaft having at one end an ivory
point firmly attached by thongs and rivets, the point tapering toward
the end. The point was slanting on one side so as to form almost an
oblique cone. Thus it facilitated the separation of the harpoon head
from the unang. On the opposite end of the shaft another piece of ivory
was attached, generally forming a knob. The material used in making the
shaft was wood, bone, or ivory, according to the region in which it was
manufactured. In Iglulik and in Aggo the narwhal’s horn was the favorite
material for the whole implement, a&nbsp;single horn being sufficient to
make a whole shaft. Wherever wood could be procured small pieces were
ingeniously lashed together. As the shaft is apt to be broken by the
struggles of the animal when struck by the weapon, it was strengthened
by a stout thong running along the whole length of the shaft. In all
other respects the old design corresponds to the modern one.
Unfortunately I have seen no specimen of this description, but a figure
may be seen in Ross II, p.&nbsp;272, in the hand of one of the natives.
In Alaska a similar harpoon is in use, a&nbsp;specimen of which is
represented in Fig. 390. It consists of a wooden shaft, with a stout
ivory point at the lower end and another at the upper end. Both are
fastened to the shaft by whalebone strings. In the upper end a slanting
ivory point is inserted, which serves for attaching the harpoon head to
it. The whole shaft is strengthened by a seal line, as shown in the
figure.</p>

<p>The unang now in use in Baffin Land and on the western shore of
Hudson Bay (Fig. 391) consists of a wooden shaft into which an iron rod
(unartenga) is sunk. The latter is pointed at the end (see, also, Fig.
393) in about the same way as the old ivory implement. The socket is
secured by a small ivory ring (unaqiuta) or a string wound around the
end of the shaft. In the socket close to the iron rod
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page472" id =
"page472">472</a></span>
a bent nail is inserted, forming a narrow eye (tagusiarbing). Near the
center of the whole implement a small piece of ivory (tikagung; see,
also, <a href = "#fig418">Fig. 418</a>) is fastened to the shaft,
forming a support for the hand when throwing the weapon. At the lower
end of the shaft a string of deer sinews or a thong is fastened, forming
a loop (nabiring) which passes through a hole drilled through the shaft.
A&nbsp;stout iron point is also attached to the lower end of the shaft
(tounga).</p>

<p>The natives carry this implement on all their winter excursions, as
it is serviceable for numerous purposes. It is always kept within reach
on the sledge, as the strong iron point is useful for cutting down
hummocks, should any obstruct the passage of the sledges, or for cutting
holes through the ice, or it takes the place of a hatchet in breaking
the frozen meat which is carried along for dogs’ food. The long iron rod
is extremely useful in trying the strength of the ice or the depth of
the snow. By taking precautionary measures of this kind the natives pass
over extensive floes of weak ice.</p>

head (Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin. IV A 6729.) ½</p>
</div>

<p>The head belonging to the unang is called naulang. Since iron has
been introduced in Baffin Land and Hudson Bay, the natives file their
harpoon heads out of it, but adhere almost exactly to the old pattern.
The old naulang was cut out of bone or more frequently out of ivory
(Fig. 392). It was one inch to two inches long and had a piece of metal
inserted into the slit at the top. Through the middle of the instrument
a hole was drilled parallel to the plane of the blade. The harpoon line
passed through the hole, and as soon as the point struck an animal and a
strain was put upon the line it turned at a right angle to the latter,
thus acting as a toggle. The effect was increased by two points at the
lower end of the naulang, called uming (beard). These pressed into the
flesh or the skin of the animal and prevented the harpoon head from
slipping back.</p>

<p>The modern naulang (Fig. 393) is about the same length as the old
one, but much more slender. While the back of the old pattern was
straight, the points of the iron one are bent outward and backward in
order to increase its effect.</p>

<p>The naulang is fastened to the harpoon line (iparang). This part of
the instrument is much longer than the unang, as it must allow for the
struggles of the diving seal. The end of the line passes through the
hole of the naulang and a loop is formed and secured by deer sinew or
arranged as may be seen in Fig. 393. At a distance equal to the length
of the iron rod of the unang a small thong (taguta) is attached to the
line and serves to fasten it to the shaft (see <a href =
"#fig391">Fig.&nbsp;391</a>). It is drawn through
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page474" id =
"page474">474</a></span>
the eye formed by the tagusiarbing. As soon as a strain is put upon the
naulang the line parts from the shaft, as the taguta is only squeezed
into the eye and is easily detached. The harpoon line passes through the
nabiring or is fastened by a slipping hitch to the shaft of the
unang.</p>

<p>If the unang has a nabiring the line passes through this loop.
A&nbsp;few feet below it a small piece of ivory (akparaiktung) is
attached to the line, acting as a hook after it has run out. It catches
the nabiring and drags the harpoon along, thus impeding the movements of
the animal (see <a href = "#fig391">Fig.&nbsp;391</a>).</p>

<p>The rest of the line is coiled up and held by the hunter. The end is
doubled so as to form a loop which serves as a handle when the line runs
out with the diving seal. Generally, a&nbsp;small piece of leather (Fig.
394) with two slits at one end and an ivory clasp (qilertuang) at the
other is fastened to this loop; it serves to hold the bights together
when the line is detached from the harpoon and rolled up. Some art is
bestowed on the manufacture of this clasp (Fig. 394). Usually it
represents a seal, the head of which forms a hook on which the slits can
be fastened. The clasp is either tied or otherwise secured to the
leather strap. Some specimens in the British Museum, which are about one
hundred and fifty years old, show that these implements have not
undergone any change during that time.</p>

<p>Parry describes another harpoon head used by the Iglulirmiut for the
unang. He calls it a siatko (Fig. 395). I&nbsp;myself have not seen any
of a similar pattern, but Kumlien gives a sketch of one found in a grave
at Exeter Sound (Fig. 396). The principal difference between the naulang
and the siatko is that the edge of the former is parallel to the hole
through which the line passes, while in the latter their directions are
vertical to each other. The head of the whaling harpoon (see <a href =
"#fig436">Fig. 436</a>) acts on the same principle.</p>

<p>When the day begins to dawn the Eskimo prepares for the hunt. The
dogs are harnessed to the sledge and the hunting implements are fitted
up. The harpoon line and the snow knife are hung over the deer’s
antlers, which are attached to the hind part of the sledge, a&nbsp;seal
or bear skin is lashed upon the bottom, and the spear secured under the
lashing. The hunter takes up the whip and the dogs set off for the
hunting ground. When near the place where he expects to find seals, the
hunter stops the team and takes the implements from the sledge, which is
then turned upside down. The points of the runners and the short brow
antler are pressed into the snow in order to prevent the dogs from
running away. A&nbsp;dog with a good scent is then taken from the team
and the Eskimo follows his guidance until a seal’s hole is found. In
winter it is entirely covered with snow, but generally a very small
elevation indicates the situation. The dog is led back to the sledge and
the hunter examines the hole to make sure that it is still visited by
the seal. Cautiously he cuts a hole through the snow covering and peeps
into the excavation. If the water is covered with a new coat of ice the
seal has left the hole and it would be in vain to expect its return. The
hunter must look for a new hole promising better results.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 397.</span> Eskimo in the act of striking
a seal. (From a photograph.)</p>

<p>If he is sure that the seal has recently visited a hole he marks its
exact center on the top of the snow and then fills up his peep hole with
small blocks of snow. All these preparations must be made with the
utmost precaution, as any change in the appearance of the snow would
frighten away the seal. The Eskimo take particular
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page476" id =
"page476">476</a></span>
care that no hairs from their clothing fall into the hole or remain
sticking in the snow, for they believe that the smell would scare away
the animal. The center of the breathing hole must be marked, as the game
remains invisible and only a stroke into the center will be likely to
hit it. If the snow covering is very thick and strong it is cut down,
but is replaced with loose snow, which is heaped around the end of the
harpoon, the latter being placed upon the central point. After the
harpoon has been extracted a hole remains which forms the mark for the
harpooner. If the Eskimo expects the early return of the seal, he
spreads a small piece of skin, generally that of a young seal, close to
the hole and places his feet upon it, thus keeping them warm. He fastens
the naulang to the harpoon shaft, while the lower
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page477" id =
"page477">477</a></span>
end of the line is folded up in a coil, which he holds in the left hand.
The unang is held in both hands, and thus the hunter sometimes remains
for hours, occasionally stooping and listening, until he hears the
blowing of the seal. Then, all of a sudden, he stands upright, and, with
all his strength, sends the harpoon straight downward into the hole,
paying out the line at the same time, but keeping a firm hold of the
loop at its end (Fig. 397). Generally the seal is struck near the head.
If the line is fastened to the shaft by a slipping hitch it is at once
detached and the harpoon either remains sticking in the snow or falls
down by the hole. If the line runs through the nabiring, the harpoon is
dragged into the water and impedes the movements of the animal. The
hunter then begins at once to cut down the snow covering with his knife,
which has been left within easy reach, and hauls in the line. As soon as
the seal comes to the surface to breathe it is easily dispatched and
drawn up on the ice.</p>

</div>

<p>The arrangements at the seal hole are more elaborate if the sealer
expects to wait a long time. If only a few men go out hunting and famine
is impending, he sometimes waits for a whole day or even longer, though
it be cold and the wind rage over the icy fields. He builds up a
semicircular wall of snow blocks to keep off the piercing wind and makes
a seat in the center of it. A&nbsp;skin is spread under his feet and his
legs are tied together with a thong, which is fastened by a peculiar
kind of buckle (tutareang) with two holes (Fig. 398). One end of the
thong is firmly tied to the buckle, passing through one of the holes,
while the opposite end passes tightly through the second hole. The thong
may be quickly opened by a strong effort on the part of the hunter,
while it helps to keep him quiet. At his right hand (Fig. 399; in this
drawing it appears on the left) the snow knife is stuck into the snow,
while to the left the unang is placed upon two pegs. The coil of the
line lies in his lap. His left arm is drawn out of his sleeve, that he
may more easily keep warm. Both sleeves are generally held together by a
piece of deer’s horn with a branch on each side which serves as a hook.
Thus the hunter waits until he hears the breathing of the seal. As it
usually stays for several minutes he is in no hurry to get ready.
Cautiously he places his left arm into the sleeve, having first
disengaged it from the hook.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page478" id =
"page478">478</a></span>
He then takes hold of the coil, picks up his unang, and, having risen,
strikes the center of the hole.</p>

<p>Ross (II, p. 268) and Rae (I, p. 123) state that the sealing at the
hole is more difficult in daylight than in the dark. I&nbsp;suppose,
however, that when the snow is deep there is no difference; at least the
Eskimo of Davis Strait never complain about being annoyed by the
daylight.</p>

<p>Sometimes a small instrument is used in the hunt to indicate the
approach of the seal. It is called qipekutang and consists of a very
thin rod with a knob or a knot at one end (Parry II, p.&nbsp;550,
Fig.&nbsp;20). It is stuck through the snow, the end passing into the
water, the knob resting on the snow. As soon as the seal rises to blow,
it strikes the rod, which, by its movements, warns the Eskimo. Generally
it is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page479" id =
"page479">479</a></span>
made of whalebone. Sometimes a string is attached to the knob and
fastened by a pin to the snow, as its movements are more easily detected
than those of the knob. The natives are somewhat averse to using this
implement, as it frequently scares the seals.</p>

<p>After the carcass of the animal has been drawn out of the water, the
wounds are closed with ivory plugs (tuputang) (Fig. 400), which are
carried in a wooden or leathern case (Fig. 401) and are either
triangular or square. The plug is pushed under the skin, which is
closely tied to its head. Another form of plug which, however, is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page480" id =
"page480">480</a></span>
rarely used, is represented in Fig. 402. The skin is drawn over the plug
and tied over one of the threads of the screw cut into the wood. After
the dead animal’s wounds are closed, a&nbsp;hole is cut through the
flesh beneath the lower jaw and a thong is passed through this hole and
the mouth. A&nbsp;small implement called qanging is used for fastening
it to the seal. It usually forms a toggle and prevents the line from
slipping through the hole. The patterns represented in Fig. 403 are very
effective. The hole drilled through the center of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page481" id =
"page481">481</a></span>
instrument is wider at the lower end than elsewhere, thus furnishing a
rest for a knot at the end of the thong. The points are pressed into the
flesh of the seal, and thus a firm hold is secured for the whole
implement. The Eskimo display some art in the manufacture of this
implement, and frequently give it the shape of seals and the like (Fig.
404). Fig. 405 represents a small button, which is much less effective
than the other patterns. A&nbsp;very few specimens consist merely of
rude pieces of ivory with holes drilled through them. Fig. 406 shows one
of these attachments serving for both toggle and handle.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the line from getting out of order, a whirl
(qidjarung) is sometimes used. Fig. 407 represents one brought
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page482" id =

from Cumberland Sound by Kumlien, and is described by him (p.&nbsp;38).
There was a ball in the hollow body of this instrument, which could not
be pulled through any of the openings. One line was fastened to this
ball, passing through the central hole, and another one to the top of
the whirl. A&nbsp;simpler pattern is represented in Fig. 408.</p>

<p>On its capture, the seal is dragged to the sledge and after being
covered with the bearskin is firmly secured by the lashing. It freezes
quickly and the hunter sits down on top of it. If the seal happens to
blow soon after the arrival of the hunter, a&nbsp;second one may be
procured, but generally the day is far spent when the first seal is
killed.</p>

<p>Wherever water holes are found they are frequently visited during the
winter by the Eskimo, especially by those who have firearms. They lie in
wait at the lower side of the hole, i.e., the side to which the tide
sets, and when the seal blows they shoot him, securing him with the
harpoon after he has drifted to the edge of the ice. These holes can
only be visited at spring tides, as in the intervals a treacherous floe
partly covers the opening and is not destroyed until the next spring
tide.</p>

<p>In March, when the seal brings forth its young, the same way of
hunting is continued, besides which young seals are eagerly pursued. The
pregnant females make an excavation from five to ten feet in length
under the snow, the diving hole being at one end. They prefer snowbanks
and rough ice or the cracks and cavities of grounded ice for this
purpose, and pup in these holes. The Eskimo set out on light sledges
dragged by a few dogs, which quickly take up the scent of the seals. The
dogs hurry at the utmost speed to the place of the hole, where they stop
at once. The hunter jumps from the sledge and breaks down the roof of
the excavation as quickly as possible, cutting off the retreat of the
seal through its hole if he can. Generally the mother escapes, but the
awkward pup is taken by surprise, or, if very young, cannot get into the
water. The Eskimo draws it out by means of a hook (niksiang) and kills
it by firmly stepping on the poor beast’s breast. An old pattern of the
hook used is represented according to Kumlien’s drawing in Fig. 409;
another, made from a bear’s claw, in Fig. 410; the modern pattern, in
Fig. 411.</p>

<p>Sometimes the natives try to catch the old seal in a most cruel way,
by using the love of the dam for her pup to lure her to the surface of
the hole. They tie a thong to the hind flipper of the pup and throw it
into the hole. It dives at once, crying pitifully. When it comes up to
breathe the hunter pushes it back, and frequently the dam returns to her
young and attempts to draw it away. As soon as she is seen the harpoon
is plunged into her body and she is quickly drawn out of the water and
killed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page483" id =
"page483">483</a></span>
<p>The young seal is also pursued by foxes, which drag it from the
excavation and leave nothing but the skin, which becomes a welcome find
for the Eskimo.</p>

<p>As the season advances and the rays of the sun become warmer the
seals break down the snow roofs and are seen basking beside their holes.
The young ones remain with their dams until late in June.</p>

<p>At this season a new method of hunting is practiced, by which seals
are caught with greater ease than in winter. The hunter approaches
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page484" id =
"page484">484</a></span>
the animal from the windward side until he is within seventy or eighty
yards of it. He then lies down, after having fastened a piece of skin
under his left arm, upon which he reclines. The skin protects him from
the melting snow, facilitates speed, and diminishes the noise as he
creeps. He moves on toward the seal, resting on his left arm and side
and pushing himself forward with his right foot and left arm (Fig. 412).
The seal frequently raises his head and gazes around to make sure that
no danger threatens. As long as the seal is looking around the hunter
lies flat and keeps perfectly still, or, if he is somewhat close to the
animal, imitates its movements by raising his head and rolling and
playing with his hands and feet as a seal does with its flippers. Some
natives will utter sounds similar to those of a blowing seal or use a
small sledge with a white screen to conceal themselves from view. The
sealskin clothing makes man and seal look so extremely alike that it is
difficult to distinguish one from the other at some distance. If the
hunter succeeds in deceiving the animal it lies down again to sleep and
he pushes himself on. As the naps of the seal last but a few moments,
the Eskimo approaches very slowly. At last he is near enough. He levels
his gun and tries to hit the animal’s head, as it must be killed by the
first shot, else it jumps into the hole and escapes. If the snow is hard
and water has not yet appeared on the top of the ice, a&nbsp;seal may be
killed in this way in twenty or thirty minutes. If the snow is very soft
and deep it is almost impossible to get near enough, as it is extremely
difficult to push one’s self along. The approach is rather easy through
rough ice, which conceals the hunter, but the seals seldom frequent such
places. Sometimes they are found at the edges of rough ice or near the
shore and are easily caught when in this position.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 412.</span> Eskimo approaching seal.
(From a photograph.)</p>

<p>Formerly, the harpoon was used instead of the gun, and is even now
preferred by some hunters. The hunter gets near enough to reach the seal
with the harpoon, and having struck his prey has a better chance of
securing it, as the weapon prevents its escape.</p>

<p>After the shot has been fired or the harpoon thrown, the Eskimo at
once jumps to his feet in order to prevent the escape of the animal
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page485" id =
"page485">485</a></span>
to its hole, to which it takes if only wounded. An expert hunter can
kill from ten to fifteen seals in one day.</p>

<p>Rae, in describing the method of hunting, states (I, p. 170) that the
women at Repulse Bay are very skillful, and when they have no harpoon
frequently use a small wooden club, with which they strike the seal on
the nose, killing it.</p>

<p>Generally two men go sealing together. They set out early in the
morning on one sledge, and while one creeps toward the seals the other
keeps the dogs quiet. A&nbsp;single hunter cannot hunt successfully at
this season with a sledge, for when he leaves it the dogs will either
follow him or, if made fast to the ice, raise such a howling that the
seal is put upon its guard. Therefore it is necessary that a continuous
watch be kept on the dogs. When the shot is fired and they perceive that
the seal is killed, no amount of whipping will restrain them; they rush
forward until they have reached the victim, which is then lashed on the
sledge.</p>

<p>The hunters go on in search of a second seal, at the sight of which
the dogs are again stopped. When the Eskimo intend to remain out only a
few hours they leave the dead animals at their holes and load them on
the sledge on the return journey. A&nbsp;single hunter cannot leave the
settlement for a long distance, but is limited to sealing near the
village and killing no more animals than he can drag to it himself.
Sometimes it happens that the seals are fast asleep. Then the hunter can
go up to them without any precaution and kill them immediately, and even
a dog team running at full speed can take them by surprise. In winter a
similar method of hunting is followed whenever the edge of the floe is
close to the land. In such places all kinds of seals lie on the ice,
even in the midst of winter, and are pursued in the way which has been
already described.</p>

<p>A strange method of hunting is reported by Ross (II, p. 451) as
practiced by the Netchillirmiut. Eight men slowly approached the basking
seal until it raised its head, when those in front stopped and shouted
as loud as they could; on which three others ran up with incredible
swiftness and the leader struck it with the spear.</p>

<p>Still later in the season, when the snow is all gone, a very
successful method of hunting is practiced. All the inhabitants of the
settlements set out at once, men, women, and children, and occupy every
seal hole over a large area. The men keep their harpoons ready to strike
the animal when it comes up to blow, while the women and children are
provided with sticks only, with which they frighten away the seals
whenever they rise where they are standing. The animals are compelled to
rise somewhere, as otherwise they would be drowned, and thus an ample
supply is secured in a short time.</p>

<p>After the breaking up of the ice the natives take to their kayaks and
the summer hunt is started. As at this season the methods of
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page486" id =
"page486">486</a></span>
catching all kinds of seal and walrus are almost identical, I&nbsp;shall
describe them together; and, first, the most important part of the
hunting gear, the kayak and its belongings.</p>

<p>The kayak (qajaq) is almost exclusively used for hunting by all
Eskimo tribes from Greenland to Alaska. According to Bessels the Ita
natives do not know its use, though they have retained the word. As a
connection exists between this tribe and those of Baffin Land,
I&nbsp;have no doubt that they are acquainted with the use of the boat,
though it may be of little avail in that ice encumbered region. When I
first visited the tribes of Davis Strait no kayak was to be found
between Cape Mercy and Cape Raper, nor had there been any for several
years. In the summer of 1884, however, two boats were built by these
natives.</p>

<p>The general principles of their construction are well known. The
kayak of the Nugumiut, Oqomiut, and Akudnirmiut is bulky as compared
with that of Greenland and Hudson Bay. It is from twenty-five to
twenty-seven feet long and weighs from eighty to one hundred pounds,
while the Iglulik boats, according to Lyon (p.&nbsp;322), range from
fifty to sixty pounds in weight. It may be that the Repulse Bay boats
are even lighter still. According to Hall they are not heavier than
twenty-five pounds (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;216).</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<img src = "images/fig413.png" width = "404" height = "47" alt = "see caption"></p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 413.</span> Frame of a kayak or hunting
boat. (Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin.)</p>

<p>The frame of the kayak (Fig. 413) consists, first, of two flat pieces
of wood which form the gunwale (apumang). From ten to twenty beams
(ajang) keep this frame on a stretch above. The greatest width between
them is a little behind the cock pit (p.&nbsp;487). A&nbsp;strong piece
of wood runs from the cross piece before the hole (masing) to the stem,
and another from the cross piece abaft the hole (itirbing) to the stern
(tuniqdjung). The proportion of the bow end to the stern end, measured
from the center of the hole, is 4 to&nbsp;3. The former has a projection
measuring one-fourth of its whole length. Setting aside the projection,
the hole lies in the very center of the body of the kayak. A&nbsp;large
number of ribs (tikping), from thirty to sixty, are fastened to the
gunwales and kept steady by a keel (kujang), which runs from stem to
stern, and by two lateral strips of wood (siadnit), which are fastened
between gunwale and keel. The stem projection (usujang), which rises
gradually, begins at a strong beam (niutang) and its rib (qaning). The
extreme end of the stern (aqojang) is bent upward. The bottom of the
boat is partly formed by the keel, partly by the side supports. The
stern projection has a keel, but in the body of the boat the side
supports are bent down to the depth of the keel, thus forming a flat
bottom. Rising again gradually they terminate
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page487" id =
"page487">487</a></span>
close to the stern. Between the masing and the itirbing is the hole (pa)
of the kayak, the rim of which is formed by a flat piece of wood or
whalebone bent into a hoop. It is flattened abaft and sharply bent at
the fore part. The masing sometimes rests upon a stud.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 414.</span> Kayak with covering of skin.
(Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin.)</p>

<p>The whole frame is covered with skins (aming) tightly sewed together
and almost waterproof (Fig. 414). Usually the cover consists of three or
four skins of <i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>. When put upon the frame it is
thoroughly wetted and stretched as much as possible so as to fit
tightly. It is tied by thongs to the rim of the hole. A&nbsp;small piece
of ivory is attached to each side of the niutang and serves to fasten a
thong which holds the kayak implements. Two more thongs are sewed to the
skin just before the hole, another one behind it, and two smaller ones
near the stern.</p>

<p>The differences between this boat and that of the Iglulirmiut may be
seen from Lyon’s description (page 320). Their kayak has a long peak at
the stern, which turns somewhat upward. The rim round the hole is higher
in front than at the back, whereas that of the former has the rim of an
equal height all around. At Savage Islands Lyon saw the rims very neatly
edged with ivory. The bow and the stern of the Iglulik kayaks were
equally sharp and they had from sixty to seventy ribs. While the kayaks
of the Oqomiut have only in exceptional cases two lateral supports
between keel and gunwale, Lyon found in the boats of these natives seven
siadnit, but no keel at all. These boats are well represented in Parry’s
engravings (II,&nbsp;pp.&nbsp;271 and 508). Instead of the thongs, ivory
or wooden holders are fastened abaft to prevent the weapons from
slipping down.</p>

<p>If the drawing in Lyon’s book (p. 14) be correct, the kayak of the
Qaumauangmiut (Savage Islands) has a very long prow ending in a sharp
peak, the proportion to the stern being 2 to&nbsp;1. Its stern is much
shorter and steeper than that of the northern boats and carries the same
holders as that of the Iglulirmiut.</p>

<p>The model of a Repulse Bay kayak is represented in Fig. 415. The rim
of the hole is in the same position as in the Iglulik kayak, the fore
part resting on a rib bent like a hoop, whereas in the others
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page488" id =
"page488">488</a></span>
it rests on a beam. The stern resembles closely that of the Cumberland
Sound boats, while the head is less peaked, the keel having a sharper
bend at the beginning of the projection, which does not turn upward.
Early in the spring and in the autumn, when ice is still forming,
a&nbsp;scraper (sirmijaung) (Fig. 416) is always carried in the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page489" id =
"page489">489</a></span>
kayak for removing the sleet which forms on the skin. When the boat has
been pulled on shore, it is turned upside down and the whole bottom is
cleaned with this implement. A&nbsp;double bladed paddle (pauting) is
used with the boat. It has a narrow handle (akudnang), which fits the
hand of the boatman and widens to about four inches at the thin blades
(maling), which are edged with ivory. Between each blade and the handle
there is a ring (qudluqsiuta).</p>

<p>The kayak gear consists of the large harpoon and its line
(to&nbsp;which the sealskin float is attached), the receptacle for this
line, the bird spear (with its throwing board), and two lances.</p>

<p>The large harpoon (Fig. 417) is used for hunting seals and walrus
from the kayak. The shaft (qijuqtenga) consists of a stout pole from
four and a half to five feet in length, to which an ivory knob is
fastened at the lower end. At its center of gravity a small piece of
ivory (tikagung) is attached, which serves to support the hand in
throwing the weapon. A&nbsp;remarkable pattern of this tikagung, which
nicely fits the hand of the hunter, is represented in the first of the
series of Fig. 418, and another one, which differs only in size from
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page490" id =
"page490">490</a></span>
that of the unang, in the second. At right angles to the tikagung a
small ivory knob is inserted in the shaft and serves to hold the harpoon
line. At this part the shaft is greatly flattened and the cross section
becomes oblong or rhombic. At the top it is tenoned, to be inserted into
the mortice of the ivory head (qatirn). The latter fits so closely on
the tenon that it sticks without being either riveted or tied together.
The qatirn is represented in Fig. 419. Into the cavity at its top a
walrus tusk is inserted and forms with it a ball and socket joint
(igimang).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The tusk and the qatirn are fastened to each other in a most
ingenious way, which may be readily made out from the engraving (Fig.
420). The principal effect of this arrangement of the holes and the
thong is that the tusk is kept steady by two parallel thongs that
prevent it from tipping over and only allow a movement in the plane of
the flattening of the shaft as soon as any considerable force is applied
to the tusk.</p>

<p>The harpoon head used in connection with this weapon is the tokang.
To prevent it from being injured, it is carried in a wooden sheath (Fig.
421). The iron point is secured by a string of whalebone or sealskin;
the lower part is fastened to the sheath as indicated in the figure. The
tokang differs from the naulang in that it is larger and stouter. In
some cases great care is bestowed upon the finishing of this important
weapon.</p>

<p>An interesting specimen of this variety of harpoon head was found by
Kumlien in Cumberland Sound (Fig. 422). It was taken from a whale and
differs from the device of that country. The back is bent similar to
that of the iron naulang and the barbs have two points each instead of
one. The front part is sharply ridged. The specimen is very nicely
finished. A&nbsp;few very old harpoon heads of the same pattern are
deposited in the British Museum and were of Hudson Strait manufacture;
therefore I conclude that Kumlien’s specimen is from the same part of
the country.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 423.</span> Ancient tokang or harpoon
head. (In A.&nbsp;Sturgis’s collection, New York.)</p>

<p>Fig. 423 represents an ancient harpoon head of the same style, the
locality of which is unfortunately unknown. The specimen is of
particular interest, as it shows the method of fastening the stone to
the ivory part. A&nbsp;similar specimen is in the collections of the
British Museum; it formed part of the Sloane collection. Both these
specimens show perforations at the lower end of the harpoon head which
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page491" id =
"page491">491</a></span>
are not found in the modern ones. Probably these served for holding the
harpoon head to the shaft by means of a thin line, in order to prevent
the head from coming off before the seal or walrus was struck. These
holes are similar to the ones shown in <a href = "#fig395">Figs. 395</a>
and <a href = "#fig436">436</a>.</p>

<p>The harpoon line (alirn) is attached to the tokang in the same way as
the iparang is to the naulang. When it is fastened to the igimang, the
bend of the tusk facilitates the disengagement of the harpoon head,
which turns its back to that of the tusk. Attached to the line at the
level of the ivory knob which has been mentioned is the teliqbing (Fig.
424), into the hole of which the knob fits closely. As the line from the
tokang to the teliqbing is just long enough to allow it to be pulled
down far enough to reach the knob, it holds shaft and head firmly
together so long as the tusk remains in its position. As soon as a
lateral strain is put upon the tusk the distance between the head and
the knob is diminished and the teliqbing slips off, thus disengaging the
line with the harpoon head from the shaft. Sometimes the teliqbing has
two holes, one being used when the line is wet and longer, the other
when it is dry and shorter.</p>

<p>In Iglulik the spear is called qatilik (Fig. 425). In pattern it is
the same as that of Akudnirn and Oqo, the only difference, according to
Parry’s description, being that the toung (the tusk) is straight and has
a notch near its socket (see Fig. 425), while the harpoon head which
belongs to it has only a single point at its lower end.</p>

(National Museum, Washington. 30009.)</p>

<p>This harpoon is placed on the right side of the prow of the kayak,
with the point directed towards its head. The harpoon line, with the
tokang, lies just before the hunter in a flat receptacle (asedlun),
which consists of a wooden ring with a handle, held by thongs before the
hole of the kayak. The receptacle rests on the skin cover, having no
feet, as has the Greenland one. In Hudson Strait it is secured upon
holders. The harpoon line is rolled up in a coil, but its end is
fastened to the seal float, which lies behind the hunter and is held in
place by a thong. The line passes along the right side of the kayak
hole. The float (avautang) (Fig. 426) consists of a whole sealskin which
had been removed from the animal dexterously, its
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page493" id =
"page493">493</a></span>
entire body being pulled through the mouth, which is enlarged by means
of a cut along the throat. The nails of the flippers are frequently
extracted and the openings sewed up, the hind flippers and the tail
being cut off and firmly tied together by a thong, thus forming a neck
(atauta), to which the harpoon line is attached. At the head a pipe for
blowing up the skin (poviutang) is inserted (Fig. 427); the skin is
firmly tied to the ring of the pipe, on which the stopper is secured as
soon as the skin is sufficiently inflated. This device is a very
convenient one, for it is difficult to inflate the skin without some
kind of mouthpiece. If there are any holes in the float they are closed
by a button similar to the one shown in Fig. 427&nbsp;<i>a</i>, which,
however, is without a hole.</p>

<p>If the harpoon is to be used for hunting large animals, such as
walrus or whales, a&nbsp;very ingenious contrivance is sometimes
inserted between the line and the float in the shape of a wooden hoop
with a seal or deer skin stretched over it (niutang) (see <a href =
"#fig437">Fig.&nbsp;437</a>). Three or four thongs of equal length are
fastened to the hoop at equal distances and bound together. At their
point of union they are attached to the line. As soon as a walrus is
struck and starts to swim away, the hoop is thrown at right angles to
the stretched line and exerts a strong resistance when dragged along,
thus diminishing the speed of the animal and quickly exhausting its
strength. The float prevents its escape, as it is too buoyant to be
drawn under water. The animal cannot dive, and thus the hunter does not
lose sight of his prey.</p>

the main difference being that it is much smaller and has a seal bladder
for a float attached to the shaft. I&nbsp;have not seen this weapon
myself, but Kumlien has brought away parts of it. Fig. 429 shows that
its point differs only in size from the large igimang. The head
(probably the naulang) is tied to the shaft, which acts as a drag.</p>

<p>The points are fastened to the shaft in almost the same way as the
former, the only difference being that they are straight; the drill
holes do not cross one another. Fig. 430 represents the heads belonging

<p>In hunting walrus a lance (anguvigang) (Fig. 432) is used which is
similar to the igimang. The shaft and the joint are alike in both, only
the knob for the teliqbing being absent. The head is made of bone or the
straight part of a walrus tusk and has an iron
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page495" id =

blade on the top. The lance serves to dispatch the animal after it has
been harpooned with the igimang.</p>

<p>The joint prevents the shaft from being broken by the struggles of
the animal. Its place is behind the hunter on the right side of the
kayak, the point being directed toward the stern. Generally a second
lance is carried on the left side of the boat parallel with the other.
It is either of the same kind or a slender shaft with a long point
firmly inserted in it (kapun, ipun). The point is about one and
one-third of a foot to one and one-half feet long. This weapon, however,
is more particularly in use for hunting deer in the lakes and ponds.</p>

</div>

<p>The last implement in the kayak gear to be described is the bird
spear, nuirn (Fig. 433), with its throwing board, nuqsang (Fig. 434). It
has a shaft of about four feet in length, flattened at the lower end.
Among the natives on the east and southeast of Baffin Land it has an
iron prong at its point, whereas in Iglulik it has two points of unequal
length, with double barbs. Three double barbed prongs are attached to
the center of the shaft. They have a sharp bend at their lower part, the
points running parallel to the shaft. The prongs of the Greenland dart
are straight and diverge from the shaft. The lower end of the bird spear
fits into the groove of the throwing board. Therefore the end of the
shaft is squared. The ivory knob at the end of the spear contains a
small hole for the insertion of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page496" id =
"page496">496</a></span>
spike which is in the end of the groove. When the board is used it is
held firmly in the right hand, the first finger passing through the hole
by the side of the groove, the thumb clasping the notch on the left side
(Fig. 434&nbsp;<i>b</i>), the other fingers those on the right side. The
shaft is held by the points of the fingers. When the spear is hurled the
posterior point of the groove describes a wide circle, and the fingers
let go the shaft, which, remaining in its first position, is driven
forward by the spike with great violence, and thus it attains
considerable velocity.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page497" id =
"page497">497</a></span>
<p>I will now give a description of the methods of hunting seals and
walrus during the summer. As long as ice cakes are drifting in the bays
the natives do not use their seal floats, which would be severed from
the line and easily torn to pieces. They paddle to a small cake, on
which they lift their kayaks, and cautiously move the cake towards
another one on which a seal or walrus is asleep. After they have come
within range of their game they shoot it. As an abundance of all kinds
of seals and walrus are basking on the ice plenty of food can be
obtained.</p>

<p>An ingenious way of walrusing during this season is described by Lyon
(p.&nbsp;330):</p>

<p class = "quote">
When the hunters, in their canoes, perceive a large herd sleeping on the
floating ice, as is their custom, they paddle to some other piece near
them, which is small enough to be moved. On this they lift their canoes,
and then bore several holes, through which they fasten their tough
lines, and when everything is ready, they silently paddle the hummock
towards their prey, each man sitting by his own line and spear. In this
manner they, reach the ice on which the walruses are lying snoring; and
if they please, each man may strike an animal, though, in general, two
persons attack the same beast. The wounded and startled walrus rolls
instantly to the water, but the siatko, or harpoon, being well fixed, he
cannot escape from the hummock on which the Eskimo have fastened the
line. When the animal becomes a little weary, the hunter launches his
canoe, and lying out of his reach, spears him to death.</p>

<p>When the ice is gone seals are shot or harpooned with the igimang and
the agdliaq. The float prevents their escape and they are killed with
the anguvigang or the qapun. Later in summer, when they begin to shed
their fur, they lose almost all their blubber and sink when shot;
therefore they must be hunted with the harpoon and the float. As the
walrus is a dangerous foe should it turn upon the hunters in their light
boats, the harpoon is thrown from a great distance, and the animal is
not attacked at close quarters until it is well nigh exhausted by
dragging the float and the niutang and by loss of blood. A&nbsp;great
number of walrus are shot or harpooned while basking on the low islands
and rocks.</p>

<p>There are a few shoals and narrow inlets in Frobisher Bay and
Cumberland Sound in which great numbers of seals are caught during the
summer. In hunting them at those places some of the Eskimo in kayaks
occupy the shallow entrance of the inlet, while others scare the seals
from its head. As the seals approach its outlet they are speared by
those who are lying in wait for them. Since the natives have procured
firearms seals are shot from the boats, and in whale boats they even
attack the walrus, though they prefer to have drifting ice near at hand
in case the fierce animal should turn upon them and tear the boat with
its powerful tusks. This method of hunting is very successful in
openings which intersect the land floe in spring. To these places an
enormous number of seals and walrus
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page498" id =
"page498">498</a></span>
resort, and they are shot either when basking at the edge of the water
or when blowing.</p>

<p>In the fall, when the small bays are covered with ice and newly
formed floes drift to and fro in the open sea, the natives go sealing at
the edge of the land ice (Fig. 435). The seals are shot on the drifting
ice or in the water and are secured by means of the unang, in the
following manner: The hunter jumps upon a small cake, which he pushes on
with his spear until he is near the body of the animal, and then drags
it upon the land floe with the harpoon line. This method is almost the
same as the one used in sealing and walrusing during the winter wherever
the open water is close to the shore.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 435.</span> Sealing at the edge of the
ice. (From a photograph.)</p>

<p>This hunt is described by Gilder in the following words
(pp.&nbsp;182&ndash;184):</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>Usually there are two hunters who approach the walrus, one hiding
behind the other, so that the two appear but as one. When the spear is
thrown, both hold on to the line, which is wound around their arms so as
to cause as much friction as possible,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page499" id =
"page499">499</a></span>
in order to exhaust the animal speedily. &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>When the line is nearly run out the end of the spear
shaft is passed through a loop in the end of the line and held firmly by
digging a little hole in the ice for the end of the spear to rest in,
the foot resting upon the line and against the spear to steady it. This
gives the hunter an immense advantage over his powerful game, and if he
is fortunate enough to secure this hold there is no escape for the
walrus except that the line may cut on the edge of the sharp ice, or the
thin ice break off, and hunter, line, and all be precipitated into the
water&mdash;a not unusual experience in walrus hunting. Another cause of
misfortune is for the line to become entangled around the arm of the
hunter so that he cannot cast it off, in which case he is most assuredly
drawn into the sea, and in nine cases out of ten drowned, for his knife
is seldom at hand for an emergency and no amount of experience will ever
induce an Inung [Eskimo] to provide against danger.</p>

<p>Sometimes the hunter is alone when he strikes a walrus, and in that
case it requires considerable dexterity to secure the spear hold in the
ice; or if he fails to get that he may sit down and brace his feet
against a small hummock, when it comes to a sheer contest of muscle
between the hunter and the walrus. In these contests victory generally
perches upon the banner of the walrus, though the Inung [Eskimo] will
never give up until the last extremity is reached. Often he is dragged
to the very edge of the ice before he finds a protuberance against which
to brace his feet, and often he is drawn down under the ice before he
will relinquish his hold. He is very tenacious under such circumstances,
for he knows that when he loses the walrus he loses his line and harpoon
also.</p>
</div>

<p>Hall (I, p. 459) describes the hunt, according to his observations in
Frobisher Bay, as follows:</p>

<p class = "quote">
The line is coiled, and hung about the neck of the hunter; thus prepared
he hides himself among the broken drifting ice, and awaits the moment
for striking his game. The spear is then thrown and the hunter at once
slips the coil of line off his head, fastens the end to the ice by
driving a spear through a loop in it, and waits till the walrus comes to
the surface of the water, into which he has plunged on feeling the
stroke of the harpoon; then the animal is quickly despatched by the use
of a long lance.</p>

<p>Sometimes the walrus when swimming under an extensive floe of new ice
are drowned by being frightened down every time they try to come up to
blow.</p>

<p>Formerly whaling was one of the favorite hunts of the Central Eskimo
and in some places it is even continued to this day. Whales are either
pursued in kayaks or in skin boats. If the kayak is used, they are
harpooned in the same way as the walrus, a&nbsp;very large float
(avautapāq´) being attached to the harpoon head. The whale is pursued by
a great number of kayaks and every boatman endeavors to drive his
harpoon into the animal, which, by the loss of blood and the resistance
of the niutang and floats, is tired out and killed with lances.</p>

<p>More frequently it is pursued in skin boats (<a href =
"#page527">p.&nbsp;527</a>), which for the purpose are propelled by
means of paddles (angun). In this case the crew consists entirely of
men, although on other occasions the rowing falls to the women’s share;
a&nbsp;skillful boatman steers the boat and the harpooner stands in the
bow watching his opportunity to strike the whale. The implement used in
this pursuit is represented in Fig. 436. I&nbsp;could not procure the
weapon itself (sakurpāng´, i.e., the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page500" id =
"page500">500</a></span>
largest weapon), but had a model made by an Akudnirmio, of which the
figure is a drawing. The shaft is said to be very long and heavy,
measuring from ten to twelve feet. To this shaft a bone point tapering
towards the end is firmly attached. The harpoon head consists of two
pieces similar to the siatko of the Iglulirmiut (see <a href =
"#fig395">Fig.&nbsp;395</a>). The iron edge is inserted into a flat
piece of bone, which fits into the slit of a large head. The latter is
made from the jawbone of a whale and is extremely heavy. When the whale
is struck, both parts, the head and the edge, are disengaged from the
shaft and separated from each other, but both enter the flesh of the
whale and work in the same way as the tokang.</p>

<p>The long harpoon line is coiled up on the first thwart of the boat.
On the second one the niutang and five large floats (Fig. 437), which
were fastened to the line, are kept ready and heaved overboard as soon
as the harpoon is fast to a whale. The buoys and the niutang tire it out
quickly and the boat can easily follow it up. It is lanced with the
kalugiang whenever it comes up to blow. This lance consists of a heavy
handle with a long point of rod iron; formerly bone or narwhal ivory,
with an iron edge inserted into its point, was used for this
purpose.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page501" id =
"page501">501</a></span>
<p>The narwhal and the white whale are hunted in the same way as the
walrus and the right whale. There are a few shallow bays to which the
white whale resorts in the summer. If a shoal of them has entered such a
bay, the Eskimo take to their boats and kayaks, and by throwing stones
frighten them into the shallowest part, where they are easily
harpooned.</p>


<h4><a name = "hunt_deer" id = "hunt_deer">DEER, MUSK OX, AND BEAR
HUNTING<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins></a></h4>

<p>When the snow has melted and the short summer is at hand the Eskimo
start for the deer hunt. The tribes possessed of firearms can easily
procure deer all the year round, particularly where uneven land
facilitates their approach toward the herd; but in summer the hunt is
most important, as it is the only season in which deerskins are fit for
clothing.</p>

<p>The favorite method of hunting is to attack the deer in the ponds
when swimming from one side to the other. In many places the deer in
their migrations are in the habit of crossing the narrow parts of lakes,
and here the natives lie in ambush with their kayaks. In other places
they are driven into the water by the Eskimo and attacked by the drivers
or by hunters stationed on the lake. Favorite places for such a chase
are narrow peninsulas, generally called nedlung. The Eskimo deploy into
a skirmish line and slowly drive the herd to the point of the peninsula,
whence the deer, the retreat being cut off, take to the water.</p>

<p>If the shore be too straight to permit this method of hunting, they
drive the deer to a hill stretching to the lake. A&nbsp;line of cairns
(inugsung) is erected on the top, intended to deceive the deer, which
believe them a new line of hunters approaching from the opposite side.
They take to the water, as they see no retreat. If there are no hills a
line of cairns is erected in some part of the plain. Such monuments are
found all over the country, most of them having the appearance of being
very old.</p>

<p>As soon as the deer are in the water the natives pursue them in their
kayaks, and as their boats are propelled much more swiftly than the
animals can swim they are quickly overtaken and killed with the spear
(kapun). Sometimes the wounded deer will turn upon the boat, in which
cases the hunter must make his escape with the utmost speed, else he
will be capsized or the skin of the boat will be torn to pieces by the
animal’s antlers.</p>

<p>In some of the narrow valleys with steep faces on both sides the deer
are driven toward the hunters. As there is no chance for escape on
either side they are killed by the men who lie in ambush.
A&nbsp;remarkable tradition referring to the deer hunts of a fabulous
tribe in these passes is frequently told by the Eskimo (see <a href =
"#page635">p.&nbsp;635</a>).</p>

The herds when traveling north in spring and south in autumn take the
same course every year, passing rivers, lakes, and valleys at the deer
passes. Here the Eskimo stay during the migrations of the deer, as they
are sure to fall in with them and to secure plenty of meat and skins
during the season. In spring the rivers and lakes are not yet freed from
their icy fetters and the pursuit is more difficult; in the autumn,
however, they are easily captured in the water. Some important stations
of this kind are the island Qeqertome itoq tudlirn, south of Lake
Nettilling; the outlet of this lake, Koukdjuaq, particularly the
peninsula formed by the river and the south shore of the lake; the
country about Qudjitariaq, farther north, and the narrow valley between
Piling and Itirbilung: on the continent, the lakes of Rae Isthmus,
particularly North Pole Lake; some passes in the hills north of
Chesterfield Inlet; the isthmus of Boothia; the entrance of Qimuqsuq, on
Adelaide Peninsula; and Simpson Strait.</p>

<p>Referring to the last, Klutschak describes an interesting method of
hunting deer which is in vogue in that locality (p.&nbsp;130). The
narrow strait which separates Ita Island from King William Land freezes
up early in the season, and the reindeer in trying to cross the strait
frequently gather on this island. The Eskimo deploy over the icy bridge
and make a terrible noise, frightening the reindeer, which are gradually
driven toward a place the ice of which is treacherous at this time of
the year. Here they break through and, being able to move only with
great difficulty, are easily killed.</p>

<p>They have two kinds of bows (pitiqse): a wooden one (Figs. 438 and
439) and another made of reindeer antlers (Figs. 440 and 441). Parry
gives a very good description of the former (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;510):</p>

<p class = "quote">
One of the best of their bows was made of a single piece of fir, four
feet eight inches in length, flat on the inner side and rounded on the
outer, being five inches in girth about the middle where, however, it is
strengthened on the concave side, when strung, by a piece of bone ten
inches long, firmly secured by tree-nails of the same material. At each
end of the bow is a knob of bone, or sometimes of wood covered with
leather, with a deep notch for the reception of the string. The only
wood which they can procure, not possessing sufficient elasticity
combined with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page503" id =
"page503">503</a></span>
strength, they ingeniously remedy the defect by securing to the back of
the bow, and to the knobs at each end, a&nbsp;quantity of small lines,
each composed of a plat or “sinnet” of three sinews. The number of lines
thus reaching from end to end is generally about thirty; but besides
these, several others are fastened with hitches round the bow, in pairs,
commencing eight inches from one end, and again united at the same
distance from the other, making the whole number of strings in the
middle of the bow sometimes amount to sixty. These being put on with the
bow somewhat bent the contrary way, produce a spring so strong as to
require considerable force as well as knack in stringing it, and giving
the requisite velocity to the arrow. The bow is completed by a woolding
round the middle and a wedge or two here and there, driven in to tighten
it.</p>

<p>The bow represented in <a href = "#fig439">Fig. 439</a> is from
Cumberland Sound and resembles the Iglulik pattern. The fastening of the
sinew lines is different and the piece of bone giving additional
strength to the central part is wanting. In Cumberland Sound and farther
south wooden bows each made of a single piece were not very rare; the
wood necessary for their manufacture was found in abundance on Tudjan
(Resolution Island), whence it was brought to the more northern
districts.</p>

<p>The bows which are made of antlers generally consist of three pieces,
a&nbsp;stout central one slanted on both sides and two side pieces
riveted to it. The central part is either below or above the side ones,
as represented in <a href = "#fig440">Fig.&nbsp;440</a>. These bows are
strengthened by plaited sinews in the same way as the wooden ones and
generally the joints are secured by strong strings wound around them.
A&nbsp;remarkable bow made of antlers is represented in Fig. 441. The
central part is not slanted, but cut off straight. The joint is effected
by two additional pieces on each side, a&nbsp;short stout one outside,
a&nbsp;long thin one inside. These are firmly tied together with sinews.
The short piece prevents the parts from breaking apart, the long one
gives a powerful spring. The specimen here represented was brought home
by Hall from the Sinimiut of Pelly Bay, and a similar one was brought by
Collinson from Victoria Land and has been deposited in the British
Museum. The strings are attached to these bows in the same way as to the
wooden ones.</p>

<p>The arrows (qaqdjung) are made of round pieces of wood generally

Fig. 443. The difference in the methods used by the Mackenzie and the
central tribes in fastening the point to the shaft is very striking. The
arrow point of the former and of the western tribes is pointed and
inserted in the shaft (Fig. 444),<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id =

and lashed to it (Figs. 442 and 443). The direction of the slant is
either parallel or vertical to the edge (Fig. 445). Other forms of
arrows are shown in Fig. 446. A&nbsp;similar difference between the
fastenings of the socket to the spear handle exists in the two
localities. The western tribes give its base the form of a wedge (Fig.
447), which is inserted in the shaft, while the Central Eskimo use a
mortise.</p>

<p>If the deer cannot be driven into the water the Eskimo either stalk
them or shoot them from a stand. In a plain where the hunter cannot hide
himself it is easier to approach the herd if two men hunt together. They
advance, the second man hiding behind the first one by stooping a
little. The bows or the guns are carried on the shoulders so as to
resemble the antlers of a deer. The men imitate their grunting and
approach slowly, now stopping and stooping, now advancing. If the deer
look about suspiciously they sit down, the second man lying almost flat
on the ground, and both, at some distance off, greatly resemble the
animals themselves. Ross (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;252) states that the
inhabitants of Boothia imitate the appearance of the deer, the foremost
of two men stalking a herd bearing a deer’s head upon his own.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to approach the deer near enough to get
within range, especially if they are hunted with bow and arrow.
Generally it is not necessary to get quite near them, for when feeding
the herd moves on in the same direction for some time, and the hunter
can hide behind a stone lying in that direction and wait until they are
within range. After the first shot has been fired they do not take to
flight at once, but stand for a few seconds, struck with surprise,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page509" id =
"page509">509</a></span>
and a clever hunter may kill two or three before they run away. If the
country is very level the Eskimo raise heaps of stones or build circular
or semicircular walls to conceal themselves and allure the animals by
grunting. As the deer possess a very fine scent they must always be
approached from the lee side.</p>

<p>An interesting method of hunting is described by Parry (II,
p.&nbsp;512) and confirmed by Hall (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;178). Parry
writes:</p>

<p class = "quote">
Two men walk directly from the deer they wish to kill, when the animal
almost always follows them. As soon as they arrive at a large stone, one
of the men hides behind it with his bow, while the other continuing to
walk on soon leads the deer within range of his companion’s arrows.</p>

<p>Hall says that one hunter hides himself behind a stone while the
other utters grunting sounds to attract it.</p>

<p>In winter deer are sometimes caught in traps made by digging holes in
the snow and covering them with slabs of the same material. Sometimes
urine is poured upon and around the trap or salt water ice is placed
upon it, in order to allure the deer (Klutschak, p.&nbsp;131). Having
been attracted to the trap they fall through the roof and are speared in
the hole.</p>

<p>Wherever the musk ox is found it is eagerly pursued by the Eskimo.
Though dogs are of no use in the chase of the nimble deer, they are of
great help in hunting this animal. When a track is found the dogs are
let loose and soon overtake the herd. The latter form a circle of
defense in which they are kept at bay until the hunter approaches. While
the dogs continue attacking and dodging, the musk oxen try to hit them
with their horns and do not heed the Eskimo, who assails them at close
quarters with a lance to which a thong is frequently attached. When an
ox is wounded it makes an impetuous attack on the hunter, who dodges to
one side. The dogs being at hand again immediately keep it at bay, thus
enabling the hunter to let fly another arrow or throw his lance again.
Thus the struggle continues until the greater part of the herd is
killed. In rare instances an ox dashes out of the circle and escapes
from the pack.</p>

<p>Polar bears are hunted in about the same manner as the musk ox. The
Eskimo pursue them in light sledges, and when they are near the pursued
animal the traces of the most reliable dogs in the team are cut, when
they dash forward and bring the bear to bay. As the hunter gets
sufficiently near, the last dogs are let loose and the bear is killed
with a spear or with bow and arrow. The best season for bear hunting is
in March and April, when the bears come up the fjords and bays in
pursuit of the young seals. At this season the she bear is accompanied
by the cub which was born in February or March. Its skin and flesh are
highly prized by the Eskimo. At some places, for instance at Cape Raper
and at Cape Kater on Davis Strait, the she bears dig holes in the snow
banks, in which they sleep during
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page510" id =
"page510">510</a></span>
the winter. The natives seek these holes and kill the bear before it
awakes.</p>

<p>The chase of the musk ox and that of the bear have become much easier
since the introduction of firearms in Arctic America, and the Eskimo can
kill their game without encountering the same dangers as formerly.</p>


<h4><a name = "hunt_small" id = "hunt_small">HUNTING OF SMALL
GAME.</a></h4>

<p>Lastly, I mention the methods used in catching smaller animals, such
as wolves, foxes, and hares. Wolves are only pursued when they become
too troublesome. Frequently they linger about the villages in winter,
and when everybody is asleep they attack the store rooms or the dogs,
which have the greatest fear of this voracious animal; for, although
dogs will brave the bear, they do not venture to resist a single wolf.
If a pack of these beasts linger about the village for weeks preying
upon the native stores, traps are finally built or the Eskimo lie in
ambush near a bait to kill them. The wolf trap is similar to the one
used to catch deer. The hole dug in the snow is about eight or nine feet
deep and is covered with a slab of snow, on the center of which a bait
is laid. A&nbsp;wall is built around it which compels the wolf to leap
across it before he can reach the bait. By so doing he breaks through
the roof and, as the bottom of the pit is too narrow to afford him
jumping room, he is caught and killed there (Rae I, p.&nbsp;135).</p>

<p>A remarkable method of killing wolves has been described by Klutschak
(p.&nbsp;192) and confirmed by the Eskimo of Cumberland Sound.
A&nbsp;sharp knife is smeared with deer’s blood and sunk into the snow,
the edge only protruding. The wolves lick the knife and cut their
tongues so severely as to bleed to death. Another method is to roll a
strip of whalebone, about two feet long, in a coil, which is tied up
with sinews. At each end a small metal edge is attached to the
whalebone. This strip, wrapped in a piece of blubber or meat, is gulped
down by the hungry wolf. As it is digested the sinews are dissolved and
the elastic strap is opened and tears the stomach of the animal.
A&nbsp;very ingenious trap is described by Parry
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;514):</p>

<p class = "quote">
It consists of a small house built of ice, at one end of which a door,
made of the same plentiful material, is fitted to slide up and down in a
groove; to the upper part of this a line is attached and, passing over
the roof, is led down into the trap at the inner end, and there held by
slipping an eye in the end of it over a peg of ice left for the purpose.
Over the peg, however, is previously placed a loose grummet, to which
the bait is fastened, and a false roof placed over all to hide the line.
The moment the animal drags at the bait the grummet slips off the peg,
bringing with it the line that held up the door, and this falling down
closes the trap and secures him.</p>

<p>Foxes are usually caught in traps. An ice house about six feet high
is built of hummocks, which are cut down with the point of the spear. It
is covered with ice slabs, only a hole in the center
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page511" id =
"page511">511</a></span>
being left. Blocks of snow and slabs of ice are piled up around the
building so as to permit easy access to the roof. Some blood is
sprinkled round the hole to attract the fox and a larger bait is placed
upon the floor of the house. The fox jumps down and, as the only exit is
in the center of the roof, cannot escape. Another trap has a slab of ice
erected in such a manner as to fall and kill the fox when he touches the
bait.</p>

<p>A third trap, similar to the one above mentioned, has been described
by Lyon, p.&nbsp;339:</p>

<p class = "quote">
It is like a small lime kiln in form, having a hole near the top, within
which the bait is placed, and the foxes (for these animals alone are
thus taken) are obliged to advance to it over a piece of whalebone,
which, bending beneath their weight, lets them into prison, and then
resumes its former position: thus a great number of them are sometimes
caught in a night. In the summer they are but rarely taken, and it is
then by means of a trap of stones, formed like the ice trap, with a
falling door.</p>

<p>Hares are either killed with small shot or with arrows or caught in
whalebone snares, as are ermines and lemmings.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 452.</span> Whalebone nooses for catching
waterfowl. (In&nbsp;the possession of Captain Spicer, of Groton,
Conn.)</p>

<p>Waterfowl of all descriptions are caught in abundance in whalebone
nooses (Fig. 452) fastened to a long whalebone line or to a thong. The
line is set along the edge of a lake, particularly near nesting places.
In shallow lakes these lines are placed across the water to catch the
diving and swimming birds, which are drawn to the shore with the line.
On the low egg islands, which are inhabited by innumerable ducks, snares
are set on the nests, and great numbers are caught in a short time.
Swans and geese are procured in the same way. Other birds, and
particularly partridges, are killed with arrows and with small shot.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page512" id =
"page512">512</a></span>
<p>Large flocks of ducks and other kinds of birds fly through certain
valleys in the fall and in spring when migrating. Great numbers are
caught here without any difficulty, as they can be killed with
sticks.</p>

<p>A favorite method of catching gulls is by building a flat snow house.
One block of the roof is translucent and so thin as to permit the
hunter, who is hidden in the house, to push his hand through it.
A&nbsp;bait is placed on this block, and as soon as a bird alights to
feed it is pulled through the roof into the hut.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of birds are caught during the molting
season. Partridges can be caught with the hand and waterfowl are pursued
with the kayak. The waterfowl dive as soon as the boat comes near them
and being frightened down again as soon as they rise they are eventually
drowned. One species of goose (kango)
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page513" id =
"page513">513</a></span>
which frequents the lakes of the country is caught in a remarkable way.
A&nbsp;circular wall of stones is raised, with a single entrance. The
Eskimo drive a flock of these birds towards the building, one man, whom
the stupid creatures follow, leading the way. As soon as they have
entered the wall the entrance is shut up and they are slaughtered. If
they happen to be met with on the water they are encircled by kayaks and
driven towards the shore, one boat leading. Then they are driven within
the stone wall as already described.</p>

<p>The most important fish is the salmon, which is caught in abundance
during the summer. When the lakes begin to break up the salmon descend
to the sea, following the narrow lead between the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page514" id =
"page514">514</a></span>
land floe and the water. In some places they are so plentiful as to fill
the water completely. Here they are speared with the kakivang (Fig.
453). This instrument consists of a handle which widens towards the end;
in the center it has a prong of bone or iron, and two larger ones at the
sides, made of deer antlers or musk ox horn. These latter diverge and
are furnished with a bone or iron nail on the inner side. The elasticity
of these side prongs is increased by thongs or strings holding them
tightly together. If the salmon are very plentiful no bait is needed and
the natives cannot spear them as quickly as they swim along. When the
ice is gone they are caught in the shallow rivers falling from the lakes
into the sea. The natives stand on the bank or step into the water.
A&nbsp;small ivory fish (Fig. 454) (eχalujang), tied by two or three
holes in the back to a plaited string of deer sinews, is used as a bait.
Frequently bear’s teeth are used for bait. They are attached to a
separate line which the hunter continually moves up and down to attract
the attention of the fish. When the salmon comes near the bait it is
speared with the kakivang. In the left hand the fisherman holds an
instrument for stringing the fish (quqartaun), some illustrations of
which are given in Fig. 455. It is made of ivory. A&nbsp;thong fastened
to the hole of the instrument has a thick knot at the opposite end. As
soon as a salmon is caught it is taken out of the nippers (kakivang) and
the point of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page515" id =
"page515">515</a></span>
quqartaun is pushed into the gills and brought out again at the mouth;
thus the fish remains sticking until it is dead. Sometimes it is killed
by pushing the ivory point of the instrument into its neck. When dead it
is pushed on the thong.</p>

<p>At some places <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">wears</ins> are built, above which the fish are caught. These
consist of dikes of stones about one and a half or two feet high, which
are piled across a creek some distance below high water mark. The salmon
cross the wall at high water, but are cut off from the sea at half tide
and are speared while there. In other places the forks of rivers are
shut off by dikes, above which the salmon gather.</p>

<p>In autumn salmon are caught when ascending the rivers. Sometimes they
linger too long in small ponds and, as the rivers quickly dry up at this
season, are prevented from getting out of the pools. Here they are
caught until late in the season. Some of these ponds freeze to the
bottom in winter, and the natives, when visiting them in the spring, cut
holes in the ice and take out the frozen fish.</p>

<p>In the early part of the spring salmon are caught with hooks
(kakliokia, Iglulik; niksiartaung, Oqo), holes being cut through the ice
of the lake. Formerly the hooks were made of deer antlers. Another
device consists of a nail, crooked and pointed at one end, the other
being let into a piece of ivory or bone (Fig. 456). A&nbsp;third one is
represented in Fig. 457.</p>

<p>The fishing line is made of plaited deer sinews and is either held in
the hand or tied to a short rod. Along with these hooks baits are used
similar to those mentioned in the foregoing description. If the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page516" id =
"page516">516</a></span>
carving represented in Fig. 458 is used, the hook is tied to it by means
of two holes on the lower side of the fish, while the line passes
through its back. The fish, in coming near the bait, is generally caught
by the hook in the back or side. In this manner salmon, trout, and all
kinds of sea fish are caught.</p>

them in use among the Utkusiksalik tribe, and Petitot (Les grands
Esquimaux, p.&nbsp;278), among the natives of Anderson River. The

<p>Most of the implements of the Eskimo are made of some part of the
animals which they pursue. The skins are used for clothing, for building
purposes, and for covering the frames of boats. Many implements are made
of bone, others of walrus tusks or narwhal horn. As wood is extremely
scarce, bone or other parts of animals must make up the deficiency.
I&nbsp;shall here describe the methods of preparing these materials.</p>

</div>

<p>The skin of the seal (<i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>) is dressed in different
ways, according to the purpose for which it is intended. In skinning the
animal a longitudinal cut is made across the belly with a common
butcher’s knife (saving). Most natives have procured this useful
instrument and even in olden times a considerable number had found their
way from Hudson Bay territory to their countries. The large knives of
their own manufacture (pilaut) are of similar form, a&nbsp;metal edge
being inserted into an ivory blade. Figure 459 is a more modern knife,
an iron blade being fastened to a bone handle.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page517" id =
"page517">517</a></span>
<p>The skin, with the blubber, is cut from the flesh with the same
knife, or still more easily with the pana, the old device of which is
represented in Fig. 460&nbsp;<i>a</i> (Parry II, p.&nbsp;550). This
knife is about one foot and a half long (Parry II, p.&nbsp;503). The use
of the small prongs near the blade was not explained by Parry. In Fig.
460&nbsp;<i>b</i> is presented a pana from the eastern coast of Hudson
Bay, collected by Dr. R.&nbsp;Bell; the handle is made of bone, the
blade of iron. The flippers are cut off at the joints, and thus the
whole skin is drawn off in a single piece. In dressing the animal the
natives open the belly and first scoop out the blood, then the entrails
are taken out, the ribs are separated from the breast bone and from the
vertebrae, the fore flippers (with the shoulders and the hind flippers)
are taken out, the only part remaining being the head, the spinal
column, and the rump bone. Generally these are not eaten, but are used
for dogs’ food.</p>

<p>The knife (ulo) used by the women serves to clean and prepare the
skins. This implement, with which almost all the cutting is done, is
shaped like a crescent, the handle being attached to the center, and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page518" id =
"page518">518</a></span>
greatly resembles a mincing knife. Fig. 461 represents the form which is
now in use. Fig. 462 is a very old ulo handle from a stone circle on
Qeqertuqdjuaq (Cape Broughton). It is made of bone and has a slit for
the slate blade. It is worth remarking that this blade had not been
riveted to the handle, but fastened with a kind of glue (see <a href =
"#page526">p.&nbsp;526</a>). There are a few arrow and harpoon heads the
blades of which are inserted in the same manner; the bone is heated and
the blade is inserted while it is hot. As it is cooling the slit becomes
narrower and the blade is firmly squeezed into the bone handle. Part of
a slate blade, which had been riveted to the handle, is shown in Fig.
463. Fig. 464 represents a handle from a recent grave.</p>

<p>In preparing the skin the women spread it over a piece of whalebone
(asimautang), a&nbsp;small board, or a flat stone, and sit down before
it, resting on their knees, the feet bent under the thighs. They hold
the skin at the nearest edge and, pushing the ulo forward, remove the
blubber from it and deposit the latter in a small tub which stands near
the board. As they proceed to the opposite end of the skin, the finished
part is rolled up and held in the left hand.</p>

<p>If the skin is to be used with the hair on it, the tough membrane
(mami) which covers the inner side is removed in the same way as the
blubber and, after it has been carefully patched up and holes have been
cut all around the edge, is stretched over a gravelly place or on snow
by means of long pegs (pauktun), which hold it a few inches above the
ground, thus allowing the air to circulate underneath it. The skin
itself is washed and rubbed with gravel, snow, or ice and every hole
made by the bullet or by the spear or in preparing it is sewed up. It
very seldom happens that the women in preparing it damage the skin or
even the thin mami. It is particularly difficult to split the skin near
a hole. First they finish the work all around it and then carefully
sever the membrane at its edge. The skin is dried in the same way as the
membrane. In the early part of spring, though it may still be very cold,
a&nbsp;few choice young sealskins are dried on snow walls which face to
the south. In order thoroughly to dry a sealskin one fine warm spring
day is needed. If the Eskimo are greatly in need of skins they dry them
in winter over the lamps. A&nbsp;frame is made of four poles, lashed
together, according to the size of the skin. A&nbsp;thong passes through
the slits along its edge and around the frame, keeping the skin well
stretched. Thus it is placed over the lamps or near the roof of the hut.
However, it is disagreeable work to dry the skins inside the huts, and,
as they are much inferior to those which are dried on the ground, the
Eskimo avoid it if they can. When so prepared the sealskins are only fit
for covering tents, making bags, &amp;c.; they are far too hard to be
used for clothing, for which purpose the skin of yearlings is almost
exclusively used. The young seals, having shed
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page520" id =
"page520">520</a></span>
for the first time, have a very handsome coat, the hair being of a fine
texture and much longer than in older animals. From the middle of May
until late in summer their skins are most suitable for the manufacture
of summer clothing, but it is necessary to protect the carcasses of the
killed animals from the burning rays of the sun as soon as possible or
the skin would be quickly spoiled.</p>

<p>After being dried they are cleaned with the sharp scraper (tesirqun),
the modern device of which is represented in Fig. 465. It consists of a
handle having a round back and a flat front, with two grooves for the
knuckles of the first and second fingers, while the thumb and the other
fingers clasp the handle. The scraper itself consists of a rounded piece
of tin riveted to the handle. The old scraper (Fig. 466) was made of a
deer’s shoulder or of some other bone. I&nbsp;have never seen any that
were made of a thigh bone, similar to those found by Lucien M. Turner in
Ungava Bay.</p>

<p>After being scraped the skin is soaked in salt water and washed

<p>Fig. 468 shows some very old stone scrapers found in graves. As the
stones are sharpened it is probable that they were used for cleaning the
skins. The hole in the right side of the handle is used for the second
finger, the grooves on the back for the third and fourth. The bone is
fastened to the handle by whalebone straps or thongs.</p>

<p>Skins of <i>Phoca annellata</i>, <i>Phoca cristata</i>, <i>and Phoca
grœnlandica</i> are prepared in the same way.</p>

<p>Those which are intended for kayak covers, boots, mittens, quivers,
&amp;c. are prepared in a different way. They are either put into hot
water or laid in a brook for a few days until the hair begins to loosen.
Then both sides are worked with the ulo, in order to clean and shave
them. When the hair is removed they are dried and made pliable in the
same way as has been described. If it is intended to make the skin as
soft as possible it is allowed to become putrid before it is cleansed.
Then the hair and the blubber are removed, and afterwards it is left to
hang in the sun for a few days until it acquires a light color.</p>

<p>The large ground seal (<i>Phoca barbata</i>) is skinned in a
different manner. Its skin is very thick, thicker even than sole
leather, and therefore extremely durable and suitable for all sorts of
lines, particularly traces, lashings, and harpoon lines, and for soles,
drinking
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page521" id =
"page521">521</a></span>
cups, and boat covers. This seal is very large, sometimes attaining a
length of ten feet. The skin of the back and of the breast dries
unequally, and therefore a piece covering the throat and breast is taken
out before the rest is skinned, and the parts are dried separately. If
it is to be used for lines it is cut by making girdles about six inches
in width around the body. The hair and the blubber are removed from
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page522" id =
"page522">522</a></span>
these cylindrical rings, from which lines are made by cutting spirally,
a&nbsp;strip seventy or eighty feet long being thus obtained. This line
is stretched as taut as possible between two rocks, and while drying it
undergoes an enormous tension. Before being taken from the rocks the
edges are rounded and cleaned with a knife.</p>

<p>Walrus hide is always cut up before being prepared. As soon as the
walrus is killed it is cut into as many parts as there are partners in
the hunt, every part being rolled up in a piece of skin and carried home
in it. Sometimes the skin is used for making boats, but generally it is
cut into lines. Both kinds of hide, that of the walrus and that of the
ground seal, are as stiff as a board when dried and require much work
before being fit for use. They are chewed by the natives until they
become thin and pliable. The whole skin must be chewed in this way
before it can be used for soles and boat covers. Afterwards it is
scraped with the tesirqun and softened with the straight scraper. The
new thongs, after being dried between the rocks, must also be chewed
until they become sufficiently pliable, after which they are
straightened by a stretcher that is held with the feet (Fig. 469).
Frequently they are only pulled over the sole of the boot for this
purpose, the man taking hold of the line at two points and pulling the
intermediate part by turns to the right and to the left over the sole of
the foot.</p>

(National Museum, Washington. 9836.) 1/1</p>

<p>Another kind of line is cut from the hide of the white whale, which
is skinned in the same way as the ground seal, but, as it must be slit
on the spinal column, the single pieces of line are much shorter, and
they cannot be used to the same extent as seal lines. Some lines are cut
from the skins of <i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>, but these are weak and greatly
inferior to lines of ground seal hide.</p>

<p>Deerskins are dried in summer and dressed after the ice has formed.
Like all other kinds of skins they are not tanned, but curried. They are
hung up among the rafters of the hut, and the workers&mdash;in Oqo and
Akudnirn the women, in Hudson Bay the men&mdash;take off their jackets
and begin preparing them with the sharp scraper. After being cleaned in
this way they are thoroughly dried, either by hanging them near the roof
of the hut or, according to Gilder, by wrapping them around the upper
part of the body next to the skin, after
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page523" id =
"page523">523</a></span>
which they are again scraped with the tesirqun. This done, the flesh
side is wetted, the skin is wrapped up for half a day or a day, and
afterwards undergoes a new scraping. Then it is chewed, rubbed, and
scraped all over, thus acquiring its pliability, softness, and light
color.</p>

<p>In the spring the skins of bears and of seals are sometimes dried on
large frames which are exposed to the sun, the skins being tied to the
frames with thongs. Smaller quadrupeds, as foxes and ermines, are
skinned by stripping the entire animal through its mouth without making
a single cut in the skin. Birds are opened at the breast and the body is
taken out through this small hole, the head, wings, and legs being cut
off at the neck and the other joints. Ducks are frequently skinned by
cutting the skin around the head and the outer joints of the wings and
legs and stripping it off. The skins are cleaned by sucking out the fat
and chewing them.</p>

<p>Skins of salmon are used for water proof bags; intestines of seals,
particularly those of ground seals, are carefully dried and after being
sewed together are used for sails, windows, and kayak jackets.</p>

<p>The sewing is done with thread made of deer or white whale sinews.
Particularly are those sinews at the back dried and when intended for
use they can easily be split as thin as required. At present steel
needles are in general use. Wherever they are wanting ivory ones of the
same pattern are used (Fig. 470). The thread is fastened
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page524" id =
"page524">524</a></span>
to the eyehole by a kind of loop, the short end being twisted around the
longer one. Kumlien described a needle of a very different device
(p.&nbsp;25):</p>

<p class = "quote">
This tool was almost exactly like an awl in shape, but had an eye near
the point. They must have had to thread this instrument for each stitch.
The needle part was apparently of deer horn and the handle of walrus
ivory.</p>

<p>Probably it was used like a packing needle for sewing tent covers,
&amp;c. The needles (mirqun) are kept in ivory needle cases (umī´ujang).
The case represented in Fig. 471 is from a grave in Cumberland Sound.
The grooves on both sides are evidently intended for a leather strap
which is to be tied around it. This specimen is closed at the bottom and
had a stopper for closing the mouth. Fig. 472 is a more common pattern.
The ivory piece forms a tube through which a leather strap passes. The
needles are stuck into the leather and drawn into the tube. Small ivory
implements and ornaments are attached to both ends of the strap.</p>

<p>Thimbles (tikiq) (Fig. 473) are made of an oblong piece of ground
sealskin, fitting to the point of the first finger. A&nbsp;rim is cut
around half of its circumference and thus it can be drawn over the
finger. The women sew by pulling the thread toward them and making an
overcast seam.</p>

<p>Whalebone is used for making elastic thongs and in the place of wood;
for example, for kayak ribs, for the rim of the kayak hole, boxes,
&amp;c. It requires no particular preparation, being easily split and
shaped so as to fit any purpose. If wood is to be bent into hoops or
deer horn is to be straightened, it is made pliable by being put into
boiling water for some time. Bones of whales and other large animals and
the penis bone of the walrus are used instead of poles. In olden times,
when iron was extremely rare and an effective saw could not be procured,
they split the bone by drilling many holes, one close to the other,
afterwards breaking the pieces asunder.</p>

and bone. (National Museum, Washington. 34114.)&nbsp;⅔</p>

<p>The drill (Fig. 475) is the most important implement for working in
ivory and bone. It consists of three parts: the bow with its string
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page525" id =
"page525">525</a></span>
(niuqtung), the drill (qaivun), and the mouthpiece (qingmiaq). The
string of the bow is twisted around the shaft of the drill, the
mouthpiece (which is made of wood or of bone) is taken into the mouth,
and the rounded end of the drill is placed in its hole. Then the whole
implement is put firmly against the place to be perforated and is set in
motion by moving the bow. Instead of the latter, a&nbsp;string is
sometimes used with a handle at each end. For one man, however, the
first device is handier. The string of the second form is usually pulled
by one man while the other holds the mouthpiece.</p>

<p>The same instrument is sometimes used for making fire. Instead of the
iron, a&nbsp;piece of hard wood (ground willow) is put into the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page526" id =
"page526">526</a></span>
mouthpiece and placed upon a piece of driftwood cut to the shape
represented in Fig. 476. The wooden drill turns rapidly in a hole of the
driftwood until it begins to glow. A&nbsp;little moss is applied to the
glowing wood and gently blown until it begins to burn. Wherever flint
and pyrite are to be had these are used for striking fire. Moss or the
wool-like hair of <i>Eryophorum</i> serves for tinder.</p>

<p>Ivory implements are cut out of the tusks with strong knives and are
shaped by chipping pieces from the blocks until they acquire the desired
forms. In olden times it must have been an extremely troublesome work to
cut them out, the old knives being very poor and ineffective. They are
finished with the file, which on this account is an important tool for
the natives; it is also used for sharpening knives and harpoons. The
women’s knives are cut, by means of files, from old saw blades; the seal
harpoons, from Scotch whale harpoons. If files are not obtainable,
whetstones are used for sharpening the iron and stone implements.</p>

<p>Engravings in bone and ivory are made with the implement represented
in Fig. 477. An iron point is inserted in a wooden handle; formerly a
quartz point was used. The notch which separates the head from the
handle serves as a hold for the points of the fingers. The designs are
scratched into the ivory with the iron pin.</p>

<p>Stone implements were made of flint, slate, or soapstone. Flint was
worked with a squeezing tool, generally made of bone. Small pieces were
thus split off until the stone acquired the desired form. Slate was
first roughly formed and then finished with the drill and the whetstone.
The soft soapstone is now chiseled out with iron tools. If large blocks
of soapstone cannot be obtained, fragments are cemented together by
means of a mixture of seal’s blood, a&nbsp;kind of clay, and dog’s hair.
This is applied to the joint, the vessel being heated over a lamp until
the cement is dry. According to Lyon (p.&nbsp;320) it is fancied that
the hair of a bitch would spoil the composition and prevent it from
sticking.</p>

</div>

<p>The main part of the frame of a boat is a timber which runs from stem
to stern (Fig. 478). It is the most solid part and is made of driftwood,
which is procured in Hudson Strait, Hudson Bay, and on the northern
shore of King William Land. In Iglulik, and probably in Pond Bay, boats
are rarely used and never made, as wood is wanting. The central part of
this timber is made a little narrower than the ends, which form stout
heads. A&nbsp;mortise is cut into each of the latter, into which posts
(kiglo) are tenoned for the bow and for the stern. The shape of this
part will best be seen from the engraving (Fig. 479). A&nbsp;strong
piece of wood is fitted to the top of these uprights and the gunwales
are fastened to them with heavy thongs. The gunwales and two curved
strips of wood (akuk), which run along each side of the bottom of the
boat from stem to stern, determine its form. These strips are steadied
by from seven to ten cross pieces, which are firmly tied to them and to
the central piece. From this pair of strips to the gunwales run a number
of ribs, which stand somewhat close together at the bow and the stern,
but are separated by intervals of greater distance in the center of the
boat. The cross pieces along the bottom are arranged similarly to the
ribs. Between the gunwale and the bottom two or three pairs of strips
also run along the sides of the boat and steady its whole frame. The
uppermost pair (which is called tuving) lies near the gunwale and serves
as a fastening for the cover of the boat. The thwarts, three
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page528" id =
"page528">528</a></span>
or four in number, are fastened between the gunwale and these lateral
strips. All these pieces are tied together with thongs, rivets not being
used at all.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 480.</span> Umiaq or skin boat.</p>

<p>The frame is covered with skins of ground seals (Figs. 480, 481). It
requires three of these skins to cover a medium sized boat; five to
cover a large one. If ground seals cannot be procured, skins of harp or
small seals are used, as many as twelve of the latter being required.
The cover is drawn tightly over the gunwale and, after being wetted, is
secured by thongs to the lateral strip which is close to the gunwale.
The wooden pieces at both ends are perforated and the thongs for
fastening the cover are pulled through these holes.</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 481.</span> Umiaq or skin boat.</p>

<p>The boat is propelled by two large oars. The rowlocks are a very
ingenious device. A&nbsp;piece of bone is tied upon the skin in order
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page529" id =
"page529">529</a></span>
to protect it from the friction of the oar, which would quickly wear it
through (Fig. 481&nbsp;<i>a</i>). On each side of the bone a thong is
fastened to the tuving, forming a loop. Both loops cross each other like
two rings of a chain. The oar is drawn through both loops, which are
twisted by toggles until they become tight. Then the toggles are secured
between the gunwale and the tuving.</p>

<p>The oar (ipun) consists of a long shaft and an oval or round blade
fastened to the shaft by thongs. Two grooves and the tapering end serve
for handles in pulling. Generally three or four women work at each
oar.</p>

<p>For steering, a paddle is used of the same kind as that used in
whaling (see <a href = "#page499">p.&nbsp;499</a>). A&nbsp;rudder is
rarely found (Fig. 480), and when used most probably is made in
imitation of European devices.</p>

<p>If the wind permits, a sail is set; but the bulky vessel can only run
with the wind. The mast is set in the stem, a&nbsp;mortise being cut in
the forehead of the main timber, with a notch in the wooden piece above
it to steady it. A&nbsp;stout thong, which passes through two holes on
each side of the notch, secures the mast to the wooden head piece. The
sail, which is made of seal intestines carefully sewed together, is
squared and fastened by loops to a yard (sadniriaq) which is trimmed
with straps of deerskin. It is hoisted by a rope made of sealskin and
passing over a sheave in the top of the mast. This rope is tied to the
thwart farthest abaft, while the sheets are fastened to the foremost
one.</p>


<h4><a name = "transport_sledge" id = "transport_sledge">THE SLEDGE AND
DOGS.</a></h4>

<p>During the greater part of the year the only passable road is that
afforded by the ice and snow; therefore sledges (qamuting) of different
constructions are used in traveling.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 482.</span> Qamuting or sledge.</p>

<p>The best model is made by the tribes of Hudson Strait and Davis
Strait, for the driftwood which they can obtain in abundance admits the
use of long wooden runners. Their sledges (Fig. 482) have two runners,
from five to fifteen feet long and from twenty inches to two
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page530" id =
"page530">530</a></span>
and a half feet apart. They are connected by cross bars of wood or bone
and the back is formed by deer’s antlers with the skull attached. The
bottom of the runners (qamun) is curved at the head (uinirn) and cut off
at right angles behind. It is shod with whalebone, ivory, or the
jawbones of a whale. In long sledges the shoeing (pirqang) is broadest
near the head and narrowest behind. This device is very well adapted for
sledging in soft snow; for, while the weight of the load is distributed
over the entire length of the sledge, the fore part, which is most apt
to break through, has a broad face, which presses down the snow and
enables the hind part to glide over it without sinking in too
deeply.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 483.</span> Sledge shoe. (National
Museum, Washington. 34096.)&nbsp;¼</p>

<p>The shoe (Fig. 483) is either tied or riveted to the runner. If tied,
the lashing passes through sunken drill holes to avoid any friction in
moving over the snow. The right and left sides of a whale’s jaw are
frequently used for shoes, as they are of the proper size and permit the
shoe to be of a single piece. Ivory is cut into flat pieces and riveted
to the runner with long treenails. The points are frequently covered
with bone on both the lower and upper sides, as they are easily injured
by striking hard against hummocks or snowdrifts. Sometimes whalebone is
used for the shoes.</p>

<p>The cross bars (napun) project over the runners on each side and have
notches which form a kind of neck. These necks serve to fasten the
thongs when a load is lashed on the sledge. The bars are fastened to the
runners by thongs which pass through two pairs of holes in the bars and
through corresponding ones in the runners. If these fastenings should
become loose, they are tightened by winding a small thong round them and
thus drawing the opposite parts of the thong tightly together. If this
proves insufficient, a&nbsp;small wedge is driven between the thong and
the runner.</p>

<p>The antlers attached to the back of the sledge have the branches
removed and the points slanted so as to fit to the runners. Only the
brow antlers are left, the right one being cut down to about three
inches in length, the left one to one and a half inches. This back forms
a very convenient handle for steering the sledge past hummocks or rocks,
for drawing it back when the points have struck a snowdrift, &amp;c.
Besides, the lashing for holding the load is tied to the right brow
antler and the snow knife and the harpoon line are hung
upon&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Under the foremost cross bar a hole is drilled through each runner.
A&nbsp;very stout thong (pitu) consisting of two separate parts passes
through the holes and serves to fasten the dogs’ traces to the sledge.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page531" id =

A button at each end of this thong prevents it from slipping through the
hole of the runner. The thong consists of two parts, the one ending in a
loop, the other in a peculiar kind of clasp (partirang). Fig. 484
represents the form commonly used. The end of one part of the thong is
fastened to the hole of the clasp, which, when closed, is stuck through
the loop of the opposite end (see <a href =
"#fig482">Fig.&nbsp;482</a>). A&nbsp;more artistic design is shown in
Fig. 485. One end of the line is tied to the hole in the under side of
this implement. When it is in use the loop of the other end is stuck
through another hole in the center and hung over the nozzle. The whole
represents the head of an animal with a gaping mouth. The dogs’ traces
are strung upon this line by means of the uqsirn, an ivory implement
with a large and a small eyelet (Fig. 486). The trace is tied to the
former, while the latter is strung upon the pitu.</p>

<p>The dogs have harnesses (ano) made of sealskin (Fig. 487) or
sometimes of deerskin, consisting of two bights passing under the fore
legs. They are joined by two straps, one passing over the breast, the
other over the neck. The ends are tied together on the back, whence the
trace runs to the sledge. According to Parry (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;517),
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page532" id =

the Iglulik harnesses consisted of three bights, one passing over the
breast and shoulder and two under the fore legs.</p>

<p>It was mentioned at another place (<a href =
"#page475">p.&nbsp;475</a>) that in sealing a dog is taken out of the
sledge to lead the hunter to the breathing hole. For this purpose the
traces of some harnesses are made of two pieces, which are united by the
sadniriaq, a&nbsp;clasp similar to that of the pitu (Figs. 487, 488). If
the dog is to be taken from the sledge the fore part of the trace is
unbuttoned.</p>

<p>Besides this form of sledge a great number of others are in use.
Whenever whales are caught their bone is sawed or cut into large pieces,
which are shod with the same material. If large bones are not to be had,
a&nbsp;substitute is found in walrus skins or rolls of sealskins, which
are wetted and sewed up in a bag. This bag is given the desired form and
after being frozen to a solid mass is as serviceable as the best plank.
In Boothia frozen salmon are used in the same way and after having
served this purpose in winter are eaten in the spring. Other sledges are
made of slabs of fresh water ice, which are cut and allowed to freeze
together, or of a large ice block hollowed out in the center. All these
are clumsy and heavy and much inferior to the large sledge just
described.</p>

<p>Parry (II, p. 515) states that at Igiulik the antlers are detached
from the sledge in winter when the natives go sealing. The tribes of
Davis Strait do not practice this custom, but use scarcely any sledge
without a pair of antlers.</p>

<p>As to the appearance of the dogs I would refer to Parry (II,
p.&nbsp;515) and other writers and confine my remarks to a description
of their use by the Eskimo.</p>

<p>As the traces are strung upon a thong, as just described, the dogs
all pull at one point; for that reason they may seem, at first sight, to
be harnessed together without order or regularity; but they are arranged
with great care. The strongest and most spirited dog has the longest
trace and is allowed to run a few feet in advance of the rest as a
leader; its sex is indifferent, the choice being made chiefly with
regard to strength. Next to the leader follow two or three strong dogs
with traces of equal length, and the weaker and less manageable the dogs
the nearer they run to the sledge. A&nbsp;team is almost unmanageable if
the dogs are not accustomed to one another. They must know their leader,
who brings them to terms whenever there is a quarrel. In a good team the
leader must be the acknowledged chief, else the rest will fall into
disorder and refuse to follow him. His authority is almost unlimited.
When the dogs are fed, he takes the choice morsels; when two of them
quarrel, he bites both and thus brings them to terms.</p>

<p>Generally there is a second dog which is inferior only to the leader,
but is feared by all the others. Though the authority of the leader is
not disputed by his own team, dogs of another team will not submit to
him. But when two teams are accustomed to travel in company the dogs in
each will have some regard for the leader of the other, though
continuous rivalry and quarrels go on between the two leaders. Almost
any dog which is harnessed into a strange team will at first be
unwilling to draw, and it is only when he is thoroughly accustomed to
all his neighbors and has found out his friends and his enemies that he
will do his work satisfactorily. Some dogs when put into a strange team
will throw themselves down and struggle and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page534" id =
"page534">534</a></span>
howl. They will endure the severest lashing and allow themselves to be
dragged along over rough ice without being induced to rise and run along
with the others. Particularly if their own team is in sight will they
turn back and try to get to it. Others, again, are quite willing to work
with strange dogs.</p>

<p>Partly on this account and partly from attachment to their masters,
dogs sold out of one team frequently return to their old homes, and I
know of instances in which they even ran from thirty to sixty miles to
reach it. Sometimes they do so when a sledge is traveling for a few days
from one settlement to another, the dogs not having left home for a long
time before. In such cases when the Eskimo go to harness their team in
the morning they find that some of them have run away, particularly
those which were lent from another team for the journey. In order to
prevent this the left fore leg is sometimes tied up by a loop which
passes over the neck. When one is on a journey it is well to do so every
night, as some of the dogs are rather unwilling to be harnessed in the
morning, thus causing a great loss of time before they are caught. In
fact such animals are customarily tied up at night, while the others are
allowed to run loose.</p>

<p>Sometimes the harnesses are not taken off at night. As some dogs are
in the habit of stripping off their harness, it is fastened by tying the
trace around the body. Though all these peculiarities of the dogs give a
great deal of trouble to the driver, he must take care not to punish
them too severely, as they will then become frightened and for fear of
the whip will not work at all.</p>

<p>Before putting the dogs to the sledge it must be prepared and loaded.
In winter the shoes of the runners are covered with a thick coat of ice,
which diminishes the friction on the snow. If the shoes are of good
bone, ivory, or whalebone, the icing is done with water only, the driver
taking a mouthful and carefully letting it run over the shoe until a
smooth cover of about one third of an inch in thickness is produced. The
icicles made by the water which runs down the side of the runner are
carefully removed with the snow knife, and the bottom is smoothed with
the same implement and afterward somewhat polished with the mitten. Skin
runners and others which have poor shoes are first covered with a
mixture of moss and water or clay and water. This being frozen, the
whole is iced, as has been described. Instead of pure water,
a&nbsp;mixture of blood and water or of urine and water is frequently
used, as this sticks better to the bone shoe than the former.</p>

<p>This done, the sledge is turned right side up and loaded. In winter,
when the snow is hard, small sledges with narrow shoes are the best. In
loading, the bulk of the weight is placed behind. When the snow is soft
or there are wide cracks in the floe, long sledges with broad shoes are
by far the best. In such cases the heaviest part of the load is placed
on the middle of the sledge or even nearer the head.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page535" id =
"page535">535</a></span>
Particularly in crossing cracks the weight must be as near the head as
possible, for if the jump should be unsuccessful a heavy weight at the
hind part would draw the sledge and the dogs into the water.</p>

<p>The load is fastened to the sledge by a long lashing (naqetarun).
This is tied to the first cross bar and after passing over the load is
drawn over the notch of the next bar, and so on from one notch, over the
load, to a notch on the opposite side. After having been fastened in
this way it is tightened. Two men are required for the work, one pulling
the lashing over the notch, the other pressing down the load and lifting
and lowering the thong in order to diminish the friction, thus making
the pulling of the other man more effective. The end is fastened to the
brow antler. Implements which are used in traveling are hung upon the
antlers at the back of the sledge. In spring, when the snow is melting
and water is found under it, the travelers frequently carry in their
pouch a tube for drinking (Fig. 489).</p>

<p>When the sledge has been loaded the dogs are hitched to it and the
driver takes up the whip and is ready for starting. The handle of the
whip is about a foot or a foot and a half in length. It is made of wood,
bone, or whalebone and has a lash of from twenty to twenty-five feet in
length. The lash is made of walrus or ground seal hide, the lower end
being broad and stiff, thus giving it greater weight and a slight
springiness near the handle, which facilitates its use. A&nbsp;broad
piece of skin clasps the handle, to which it is tied with seal thongs.
Another way of making the lower part heavy is by plaiting ground seal
lines for a length of a foot or a foot and a half.</p>

<p>When starting the driver utters a whistling guttural sound which
sounds like h!h!, but cannot exactly be expressed by letters, as there
is no vowel in it, and yet on account of the whistling noise in the
throat it is audible at a considerable distance. The dogs, if well
rested and strong, jump to their feet and start at once. If they are
lazy it requires a great deal of stimulating and lashing before they
make a start. If the load is heavy it is difficult to start it and the
Eskimo must use some strategy to get them all to pull at once. The
sledge is moved backward and forward for about a foot, so as to make a
short track in which it moves easily. Then the driver sings out to the
dogs, at the same time drawing the traces tight with his hands and
pulling at the sledge. The dogs, feeling a weight at the traces, begin
to draw, and when the driver suddenly lets go the traces the sledge
receives a sudden pull and begins to move. If assistance is at hand the
sledge may be pushed forward until it gets under way.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page536" id =
"page536">536</a></span>
<p>It is extremely hard work to travel with a heavy load, particularly
in rough ice or on soft snow. The dogs require constant stimulating; for
this purpose a great number of exclamations are in use and almost every
Eskimo has his own favorite words for driving. The general exclamation,
used for stimulating is the above mentioned h! h! or aq! aq! which is
pressed out from the depths of the breast and the palate, the vowel
being very indistinct. Others are: djua! the a being drawn very long and
almost sung in a high key, or ah! pronounced in the same way; iatit! or
jauksa koksa! and smacking with the tongue. If a seal is seen basking on
the ice or if the sledge happens to pass a deserted snow hut, the driver
says, Ha! Do you see the seal? Ai! A&nbsp;seal! a&nbsp;seal!
(Ha!&nbsp;Takuviuk? Ai! Uto! uto!) and Ai! There is a house;
a&nbsp;small house! (Ai!&nbsp;Iglu; igluaqdjung!) or, Now we go home!
(Sarpoq! Sarpoq!) The latter, however, are only used when the dogs are
going at a good rate.</p>

<p>For directing the sledge the following words are used: Aua, aua! Aua!
ja aua! for turning to the right; χoiaχoi! ja χoia! for turning to the
left. In addition the whip lash is thrown to the opposite side of the
dogs. The leader is the first to obey the order, but a turn is made very
slowly and by a long curve. If the driver wants to make a sharper turn
he must jump up and run to the opposite side of the sledge, throwing the
whip lash at the same time toward the team. For stopping the dogs the
word Ohoha! pronounced in a deep key, is used.</p>

<p>If the traveling is difficult the driver must walk along at the right
side of the sledge and wherever hummocks obstruct the passage he must
direct it around them either by pushing its head aside or by pulling at
the deer’s skull at the back. But notwithstanding all this stimulating
and all the pulling the sledge is frequently stopped by striking a piece
of ice or by sinking into soft snow. As soon as it sinks down to the
cross bars it must be lifted out, and when the load is heavy the only
means of getting on is by unloading and afterwards reloading. In the
same way it must be lifted across hummocks through which a road is cut
with the end of the spear, which, for this purpose, is always lashed in
a place where it is handy for use, generally on the right side of the
bottom of the sledge. The difficulties of traveling across heavy ice
which has been subjected to heavy pressures have frequently been
described. When the sledge stops the dogs immediately lie down, and if
they cannot start again, though pulling with all their strength, the
leader frequently looks around pitifully, as if to say, We cannot do
more!</p>

<p>Traveling with a light sledge and strong dogs is quite different.
Then the team is almost unmanageable and as soon as it is hitched up it
is off at full speed. The driver sits down on the fore part and lets the
whip trail along, always ready for use. Now the dogs have time enough
for playing and quarreling with one another. Though
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page537" id =
"page537">537</a></span>
they generally keep their proper place in the team, some will
occasionally jump over the traces of their neighbors or crawl underneath
them; thus the lines become quickly entangled, and it is necessary to
clear them almost every hour.</p>

<p>If any dog of the team is lazy the driver calls out his name and he
is lashed, but it is necessary to hit the dog called, for if another is
struck he feels wronged and will turn upon the dog whose name has been
called; the leader enters into the quarrel, and soon the whole pack is
huddled up in one howling and biting mass, and no amount of lashing and
beating will separate the fighting team. The only thing one can do is to
wait until their wrath has abated and to clear the traces. It is
necessary, however, to lay the mittens and the whip carefully upon the
sledge, for the leader, being on the lookout for the traces to be
strung, may give a start when the driver is scarcely ready, and off the
team will go again before the driver can fairly get hold of the sledge.
If anything has dropped from it he must drive in a wide circle to the
same place before he can stop the team and pick it up. On an old track
it is very difficult to stop them at all. When attempting to do so the
driver digs his heels into the snow to obstruct their progress and
eventually comes to a stop. Then he stands in front of the sled and
makes the dogs lie down by lashing their heads gently. Should the dogs
start off he would be thrown upon the sledge instead of being left
behind, which might easily happen should he stand alongside.</p>

<p>The sledge is steered with the legs, usually with the right foot of
the driver, or, if it must be pulled aside from a large hummock, by
pulling the head aside or by means of the deer’s antlers. If two persons
are on the sledge&mdash;and usually two join for a long drive&mdash;they
must not speak to each other, for as soon as the dogs hear them they
will stop, turn around, sit down, and listen to the conversation. It has
frequently been said that the method of harnessing is inconvenient, as
the dogs cannot use their strength to the best advantage; but whoever
has driven a sledge himself will understand that any other method would
be even more troublesome and less effective. On smooth ice and hard snow
any method of harnessing could be used; but, on rough ice, by any other
method every cross piece would quickly break on attempting to cross the
hummocks. Frequently the traces catch a projecting point and the dogs
are then pulled back and thrown against the ice or under the sledge if
the trace does not break. If for any reason a dog should hang back and
the trace should trail over the snow the driver must lift it up to
prevent it from being caught by the sledge runner, else the dog will be
dragged in the same way as if the trace were caught by a hummock. Many
dogs are able in such cases to strip off their harnesses and thus escape
being dragged along, as the team cannot be stopped quickly enough to
prevent this. Besides the driver must see to it that the dogs do
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page538" id =
"page538">538</a></span>
not step across their traces, which in such cases would run between
their hind legs, for should this happen the skin might be severely
chafed. If the driver sees a trace in this position he runs forward and
puts it back without stopping the team. Particular attention must be
paid to this matter when the dogs rise just before starting.</p>

<p>The sledges are not used until the ice is well covered with snow, as
the salt crystals formed on the top of the ice in the autumn hurt the
dogs’ feet and cause sores that heal slowly. Late in the spring, when
the snow has melted and sharp ice needles project everywhere, the feet
of the dogs are covered with small pieces of leather, with holes for the
nails, which are tied to the leg. As they are frequently lost and the
putting on of these shoes takes a long time, their use is very
inconvenient.</p>

<p>At this season numerous cracks run through the floe. They are either
crossed on narrow snow bridges which join the edges at convenient places
or on a drifting piece of ice by floating across.</p>

<p>A few more words in conclusion concerning the training of the dogs.
The Eskimo rarely brings up more than three or four dogs at the same
time. If the litter is larger than this number the rest are sold or
given away. The young dogs are carefully nursed and in winter they are
even allowed to lie on the couch or are hung up over the lamp in a piece
of skin. When about four months old they are first put to the sledge and
gradually become accustomed to pull along with the others. They undergo
a good deal of lashing and whipping before they are as useful as the old
ones.</p>

<p>If food is plentiful the dogs are fed every other day, and then their
share is by no means a large one. In winter they are fed with the heads,
entrails, bones, and skins of seals, and they are so voracious at this
time of the year that nothing is secure from their appetite. Any kind of
leather, particularly boots, harnesses, and thongs, is eaten whenever
they can get at it. In the spring they are better fed and in the early
part of summer they grow quite fat. In traveling, however, it sometimes
happens at this time of the year, as well as in winter, that they have
no food for five or six days. In Cumberland Sound, Hudson Strait, and
Hudson Bay, where the rise and fall of the tide are considerable, they
are carried in summer to small islands where they live upon what they
can find upon the beach, clams, codfish, &amp;c. If at liberty they are
entirely able to provide for themselves. I&nbsp;remember two runaway
dogs which had lived on their own account from April until August and
then returned quite fat.</p>

<p>The Eskimo of all these regions are very much troubled with the well
known dog’s disease of the Arctic regions. The only places where it
seems to be unknown are Davis Strait and Aggo. Here every man has a team
of from six to twelve dogs, while in Cumberland Sound, in some winters,
scarcely any have been left. (See Appendix, <a href =
"#app2">Note&nbsp;2</a>.)</p>

<h4><a name = "habit" id = "habit">HABITATIONS AND DRESS.</a></h4>


<h4><a name = "habit_house" id = "habit_house">THE HOUSE.</a></h4>

<p>The houses of the Eskimo differ according to the season. All the
tribes from Smith Sound to Labrador and from Davis Strait to Victoria
Land are in the habit of building snow houses in winter. Though they
erect another more durable kind of winter house, these are more
frequently in use. The principles of construction are the same
everywhere. A&nbsp;level place is selected for erecting the snow house.
To be suitable for cutting into blocks the snowbank must have been
formed by a single storm, for blocks which are cut from drifts composed
of several layers break when cut. It must be very fine grained, but not
so hard that it cannot be readily cut with the saw or the snow knife.
The whole building is constructed of blocks of about three feet or four
feet in length, two feet in height, and from six inches to eight inches
in thickness. They are cut with snow knives or dovetail saws, which for
this reason are much in demand. The old snow knife (sulung) was made of
ivory and had a slight curve (Fig. 490).
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page540" id =
"page540">540</a></span>
The blocks are cut either vertically or horizontally, the former way
being more convenient if the snowdrift is deep. Two parallel cuts of the
breadth and the depth of the blocks are made through the drift, and
after having removed a small block the Eskimo go on cutting or sawing
parallel to the surface. A&nbsp;cross cut is then made and the block is
loosened with the point of the foot and lifted out of the bank. Vertical
blocks are more easily detached from the snowdrift than horizontal
ones.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 490.</span> Various styles of snow knife.
(National Museum, Washington. <i>a</i>, 10386; <i>b</i>, 10385.)</p>

<p>Two men unite in building a house, the one cutting the blocks, the
other building. At first a row of blocks is put up in a circle, the
single pieces being slanted so as to fit closely together. Then the
first block is cut down to the ground and the top of the row is slanted
so as to form one thread of a spiral line. The builder places the first
block of the second row with its narrow side upon the first block and
pushes it with his left hand to the right so that it touches the last
block of the first row. Thus the snow block, which is inclined a little
inward, has a support on two sides. The vertical joint is slanted with
the snow knife and tightly pressed together, the new block resting on
the oblique side of the former. In building on in this way the blocks
receive the shape of almost regular trapezoids. Every block is inclined
a little more inward than the previous one, and as the angle to the
vertical becomes greater the blocks are only kept in their places by the
neighboring ones. In order to give them a good support the edges are the
more slanted as their angle is greater.</p>

<p>This method of building is very ingenious, as it affords the
possibility of building a vault without a scaffold. If the blocks were
placed in parallel rows, the first block of a new row would have no
support, while by this method each reclines on the previous one. When
the house has reached a considerable height the man who cuts the blocks
outside must place them upon the last row. The builder supports them
with his head and pushes them to their proper places. The key block and
those which are next to it are either cut inside or pushed into the
house through a small door cut for the purpose. The key block is
generally shaped irregularly, as it is fitted into the hole which
remains; usually the last two blocks are triangular. When the vault is
finished the joints between the blocks are closed up by cutting down the
edges and pressing the scraps into the joints. Larger openings are
closed with snow blocks and filled up with loose snow pressed into the
fissures. Thus the whole building becomes a tight vault, without any
holes through which the warm air inside may escape. Such a snow house,
about five feet high and seven feet in diameter, is used as a camp in
winter journeys. It takes about two hours for two skilled men to build
and finish it. For winter quarters the vaults are built from ten to
twelve feet high and twelve to fifteen feet in diameter. In order to
reach this height the builder
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page541" id =
"page541">541</a></span>
makes a bench on which he steps while finishing the upper part of the
building.</p>

<p>The plan of a snow house of the Davis Strait tribes is a little
different from that of the Hudson Bay and the Iglulik tribes.</p>

<p>I shall first describe the former according to my own observations
(Figs. 491 and 492).</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 491.</span> Ground plan of snow house of
Davis Strait tribes.</p>
</div>

<p>The entrance to the main building is formed by two, or less
frequently by three, small vaults. The first one (uadling) is a small
dome about six feet in height, with a door two and a half feet in
height; the second one is a long passage of equal height formed by an
elliptical vault (igdluling). Its roof is generally arched, but
sometimes the top is cut off evenly and covered with slabs of snow. Both
vaults together form the entrance and are called toqsung. A&nbsp;door
about three feet high leads into the main room, the floor of which is
about nine inches above that of the former. Two very small vaults are
always attached to the whole building (Fig. 491). One is situated
alongside of the uadling and the igdluling, and serves as a storeroom
for clothing and harness (sirdloang). It is not connected with the
interior of the hut, but one of the blocks of the vault can be taken out
and is made to serve as a lid. On the left side of the entrance of the
main building is another small vault (igdluarn), which is accessible
from the main building. It serves for keeping spare meat and blubber.
Frequently there is a second igdluarn on the opposite side, and
sometimes even a third one in the igdluling. Another appendix of the
main building is frequently used, the audlitiving (Fig. 491 and Fig.
492&nbsp;<i>c</i>). It is a vault similar to the sirdloang and is
attached to the back of the main room. It serves for storing up meat for
future use.</p>

<p>Directly over the entrance a window is cut through the wall, either
square or more frequently forming an arch, which is generally covered
with the intestines of ground seals, neatly sewed together, the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page542" id =
"page542">542</a></span>
seams standing vertically (Fig. 493). In the center there is a hole
(qingang) through which one can look out. In some instances a piece of
fresh water ice is inserted in the hole. According to Ross it is always
used by the Netchillirmiut (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;250), who make the slab by
letting water freeze in a sealskin.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 492.</span> Snow house of Davis Strait,
sections.</p>

<p>In the rear half and on both sides of the door a bank of snow two and
a half feet high is raised and cut off straight, a&nbsp;passage trench
five feet wide and six feet long remaining. The rear half forms the bed,
the adjoining parts of the side benches are the place for the lamps,
while on both sides of the entrance meat and refuse are heaped up.
Frequently the snowbank on which the hut is built is deep
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page543" id =
"page543">543</a></span>
enough so that the bed needs very little raising, and the passage is cut
into the bank. As this is much more convenient in building, the huts are
generally erected on a sloping face, the entrance lying on the lower
part, which faces the beach.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig493" id = "fig493">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 493.</span> Section and interior of snow
house.</p>

<p>Before the bed is arranged and the hut furnished the vault is lined
with skins, frequently with the cover of the summer hut. The lining
(ilupiqang) is fastened to the roof by small ropes (nirtsun), which are
fastened by a toggle on the outside of the wall (Fig. 493). In the lower
part of the building the lining lies close to the wall; in the upper
part it forms a flat roof about two or three feet below the top of the
vault. The effect of this arrangement is to prevent the warm air inside
from melting the snow roof, as above the skins there is always a layer
of colder air. Close to the top of the building a small hole (qangirn)
is cut through the wall for ventilation. The lamps require a good
draught, which is secured by this hole. The cold air enters through the
door, slowly filling the passage, and after being warmed rises to the
lamps and escapes through the skin cover and the hole. The moisture of
the air forms long ice needles on the inside of the roof. Sometimes they
fall down upon the skins, and must be immediately removed by shaking it
until they glide down at the sides, else they melt and wet the room
thoroughly. Frequently a high ice funnel forms around the hole from the
freezing moisture of the escaping air.</p>

<p>The southern and western tribes rarely line the snow house. The
continuous dropping from the roof, however, causes great inconvenience,
and, besides, the temperature cannot be raised higher than two or three
degrees centigrade above the freezing point, while in the lined houses
it is frequently from ten to twenty degrees centigrade,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page544" id =
"page544">544</a></span>
so that the latter are much more comfortable. To avoid the dropping the
natives apply a cold piece of snow to the roof before the drop falls
down, which at once freezes to it, the roof acquiring by this repeated
process a stalactitic appearance. The eastern tribes use the lining in
their permanent houses without any exception. The western and southern
tribes, who leave the walls bare, heap a thick layer of loose snow over
the whole building, almost covering it up, the window and the
ventilating hole alone excepted. For this purpose snow shovels are
used.</p>

<p>The edge of the bed is formed by a long pole. The surface of the
snowbank which forms the foundation for the bed is covered with pieces
of wood, oars, paddles, tent poles, &amp;c. These are covered with a
thick layer of shrubs, particularly <i>Andromeda tetragona</i>. Over
these numerous heavy deerskins are spread, and thus a very comfortable
bed is made.</p>

<p>According to Parry the arrangement in Iglulik is as follows
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;501):</p>

<p class = "quote">
The beds are arranged by first covering the snow with a quantity of
small stones, over which are laid their paddles, tent poles, and some
blades of whalebone; above these they place a number of little pieces of
network made of thin slips of whalebone, and lastly a quantity of twigs
of birch and of the <i>Andromeda tetragona</i>. &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>The birch, they say, had been procured from the
southward by way of Nuvuk. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>There
deerskins, which are very numerous, can now be spread without risk of
their touching the snow.</p>

<p>At night, when the Eskimo go to bed, they put their clothing, their
boots excepted, on the edge of the platform under the deerskins, thus
forming a pillow, and lie down with the head toward the entrance. The
blankets (qipiq) for their beds are made of heavy deerskins, which are
sewed together, one blanket serving for a whole family. The edge of the
blanket is trimmed with leather straps.</p>

<p>On the side benches in front of the bed is the fireplace, which
consists of a stone lamp and a framework from which the pots are
suspended (see <a href = "#fig493">Fig.&nbsp;493</a>). The lamp
(qudlirn), which is made of soapstone, is a shallow vessel in the shape
of a small segment of a circle. Sometimes a small space is divided off
at the back for gathering in the scraps of blubber. The wick consists of
hair of <i>Eryophorum</i> or of dried moss rubbed down with a little
blubber so as to be inflammable. It is always carried by the women in a
small bag. The whole vessel is filled with blubber as high as the wick,
which is spread along the straight side of the vessel. It requires
constant attention to keep the desired length burning without smoking,
the length kindled being in accordance with the heat or light required.
The trimming of the wick is done with a bit of bone, <ins class =
"correction" title = "spelling unchanged">asbestus</ins>, or wood, with
which the burning moss is spread along the edge of the lamp and
extinguished or pressed down if the fire is not wanted or if it smokes.
At the same time this stick serves to light other lamps (or&nbsp;pipes),
the burnt point
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page545" id =
"page545">545</a></span>
being put into the blubber and then kindled. Sometimes a long, narrow
vessel stands below the lamp, in which the oil that drops from the edge
is collected.</p>

<p>In winter the blubber before being used is frozen, after which it is
thoroughly beaten. This bursts the vesicles of fat and the oil comes out
as soon as it is melted. The pieces of blubber are either put into the
lamp or placed over a piece of bone or wood, which hangs from the
framework a little behind the wick. In summer the oil must be chewed
out. It is a disgusting sight to see the women and children sitting
around a large vessel all chewing blubber and spitting the oil into
it.</p>

kettle.</p>
</div>

<p>The frame of the fireplace consists of four poles stuck in the snow
in a square around the lamp and four crossbars connecting the poles at
the top. From those which run from the front to the back the kettle
(ukusik) is suspended by two pairs of strings or thongs. It is made of
soapstone and has a hole in each corner for the string. The kettle which
is in use among the eastern tribes has a narrow rim and a wide bottom
(Fig. 494), while that of the western ones is just the opposite. Parry,
however, found one of this description in River Clyde
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;286). When not in use it is shoved back by means of the
strings. Since whalers began to visit the country a great number of tin
pots have been introduced, which are much more serviceable, the process
of cooking being quickened.</p>

<p>On the top of the frame there is always a wood or bone hoop with a
net of thongs stretched across it (inetang). It serves to dry clothing,
particularly boots, stockings, and mittens, over the fire. In the
passage near the entrance to the hut there is frequently a small lamp
(adlirn), which is very effective for warming the cold air entering
through the door, and in the remotest corner in the back of the hut
there is sometimes another (kidlulirn). When all the lamps are lighted
the house becomes warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>Two small holes are frequently cut in the snowbank which forms the
ledge, at about the middle of its height (see <a href =
"#fig492">Fig.&nbsp;492&nbsp;<i>a</i></a>). They are closed with small
snow blocks, each of which has a groove for a handle, and serve to store
away anything that must be kept dry.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page546" id =

At night the entrance of the inner room is closed with a large snow
block, which stands in the passage during the day.</p>

<p>These huts are always occupied by two families, each woman having her
own lamp and sitting on the ledge in front of it, the one on the right
side, the other on the left side of the house. If more families join in
building a common snow house, they make two main rooms with one
entrance. The plan of such a building is seen in Fig. 495.</p>

<p>The plans of the Iglulik and Hudson Bay houses are different from the
one described here. The difference will best be seen by comparing the
plans represented in Fig. 496 and Fig. 497, which have been
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page547" id =
"page547">547</a></span>
reprinted from Hall and Parry, respectively, with the former ones. Among
the eastern tribes I have never seen the beds on the side of the
passage, but always at the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Besides these snow houses a more solid building is in use, called
qarmang. On the islands of the American Archipelago and in the
neighboring parts of the mainland numerous old stone foundations are
found, which prove that all these islands were once inhabited by the
Eskimo. It has often been said that the central tribes have forgotten
the art of building stone houses and always live in snow huts. At the
present time they do not build houses, but cover the walls of an old hut
with a new roof whenever they take possession of it. There is no need of
any new buildings, as the Eskimo always locate in the old settlements
and the old buildings are quite sufficient to satisfy all their
wants.</p>

or stone house.</p>

<p>Those in good condition have a long stone entrance (ka´teng) (Fig.
498), sometimes from fifteen to twenty feet long. This is made by
cutting an excavation into the slope of a hill. Its walls are covered
with large slabs of stone about two and a half feet high and three feet
wide, the space between the stone and the sides of the excavation being
afterwards filled up with earth. The floor of the passage slopes upward
toward the hut. The last four feet of the entrance are covered with a
very large slab and are a little higher than the other parts of the roof
of the passageway. The slab is at the same height as the benches of the
dwelling room, which is also dug out, the walls being formed of stones
and whale ribs. The plan of the interior is the same as that of the snow
house, the bed being in the rear end of the room and the lamps on both
sides of the entrance. The floor of the hut is about eight inches higher
than that of the passage. The roof and the window, however, differ from
those of the snow house. In the front part of the hut the rib of a whale
is put up, forming an arch. A&nbsp;great number of poles are lashed to
it and run toward the back of the house, where they rest on the top of
the wall, forming, as it were, the rafters. The whole curve formed by
the rib is covered with a window of seal intestines, while the poles are
covered with sealskins, which are fastened in front to the whale rib. At
the other end they are either fastened
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page549" id =
"page549">549</a></span>
to the ribs in the wall or, more frequently, are steadied by <ins class
= "correction" title = ". missing">stones.</ins> The roof is covered
with a thick layer of <i>Andromeda</i>, and another skin, which is
fastened in the same way, is spread over both covers. This kind of hut
is very warm, light, and comfortable. The stone banks forming the bed
are covered as already described.</p>

<p>If three families occupy one house the whale’s rib which forms the
window is placed a few feet farther forward than in the previous case,
at the end of the large slab which forms the roof of the last part of
the passage.</p>

<p>By means of poles and bones a small side room is built (qareang), the
ceiling of which is sewed to that of the main room (Fig. 499). The large
slab which is in front of the window (at&nbsp;the end of the passage) is
utilized as a storeroom for both families living on that side of the
house, a&nbsp;place being left open only in the middle, where the spy
hole is. In some instances this side room is inclosed in the stone walls
of the hut.</p>

<p>A winter house built on the same plan is represented in Fig. 502. The

is covered with the double roof described above. A&nbsp;few narrow snow
vaults form the entrance. The front rib forms the door, and thus the hut
becomes quite dark. Huts of this kind are also called qarmang or
qarmaujang, i.e., similar to a qarmang.</p>

(From a sketch by the author.)</p>

<p>In Ukiadliving I found, along with a great number of fine qarmat,
some very remarkable storehouses, such as are represented in Fig. 503.
Structures of this kind (ikan´) consist of heavy granite pillars, on the
top of which flat slabs are piled to a height of from nine to ten feet.
In winter, blubber and meat are put away upon these pillars, which are
sufficiently high to keep them from the dogs. Sometimes two pillars,
about ten feet apart, are found near the huts. In winter the kayak is
placed upon them in order to prevent it from being covered by snowdrifts
or from being torn and destroyed by the dogs. In snow villages these
pillars are made of snow.</p>

<p>The purpose of the long, kayak-like building figured by Kumlien (see
<a href = "#fig500">Fig.&nbsp;500</a>) is unknown to me. I&nbsp;found a
similar one, consisting of two rows of stones, scarcely one foot high
but twenty feet long,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page551" id =
"page551">551</a></span>
in Pangnirtung, Cumberland Sound, but nobody could explain its use.</p>

<p>In the spring, when the rays of the sun become warmer, the roofs of
the snow houses fall down. At this season the natives build only the
lower half of a snow vault, which is covered with skins.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 504.</span> Plan and sections of tupiq or
tent of Cumberland Sound.</p>

<p>Still later they live in their tents (tupiq) (Fig. 504). The
framework consists of poles, which are frequently made of many pieces of
wood ingeniously lashed together. The plan (Fig. 504&nbsp;<i>a</i>) is
the same
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page552" id =
"page552">552</a></span>
as that of the winter houses. At the edge of the bed and at the entrance
two pairs of converging poles are erected. A&nbsp;little below the
crossing points two cross strips are firmly attached, forming the ridge.
Behind the poles, at the edge of the bed, six or eight others are
arranged in a semicircle resting on the ground and on the crossing point
of those poles. The frame is covered with a large skin roof fitting
tightly. The back part, covering the bed, is made of sealskins; the fore
part, between the two pairs of poles, of the thin membrane which is
split from the skins (see <a href = "#page519">p.&nbsp;519</a>), and
admits the light. The door is formed by the front part of the cover, the
left side (in&nbsp;entering) ending in the middle of the entrance, the
right one overlapping it, so as to prevent the wind from blowing into
the hut. The cover is steadied with heavy stones (Fig.
504&nbsp;<i>c</i>). In Cumberland Sound and the more southern parts of
Baffin Land the back of the hut is inclined at an angle of 45°; in Davis
Strait it is as steep as 60°, or even more. In the summer tent the bed
and the side platforms are not raised, but only separated from the
passage by means of poles.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 505.</span> Plan and sections of tupiq or
tent of Pond Bay.</p>

<p>Farther north and west, in Pond Bay, Admiralty Inlet, and Iglulik,
where wood is scarce, the Eskimo have a different plan of construction
(Fig. 505). A&nbsp;strong pole is set up vertically at the end of the
passage, a&nbsp;small cross piece being lashed to its top. The entrance
is formed by an oblique pole, the end of which lies in the ridge of the
roof. The latter is formed by a stout thong which runs over the top of
both poles and is fastened to heavy stones on both sides. If wood is
wanting, then poles are made from the penis bones of the walrus. Parry
found one of these tents at River Clyde, on his first expedition, and
describes it as follows (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;283):</p>

<p class = "quote">
The tents which compose their summer habitations, are principally
supported by a long pole of whalebone, 14 feet high, standing
perpendicularly, with 4 or 5 feet of it projecting above the skins which
form the roof and sides. The length of the tent is 17, and its breadth
from 7 to 9 feet, the narrowest part being next the door, and widening
towards the inner part, where the bed, composed of a quantity of the
small shrubby plant, the <i>Andromeda tetragona</i>, occupies about
one-third of the whole apartment. The pole of the tent is fixed where
the bed commences, and the latter is kept separate by some pieces of
bone laid across the tent from side to side. The door which faces the
southwest, is also formed of two pieces of bone, with the upper ends
fastened together, and the skins are made to overlap in that part of the
tent, which is much lower than the inner end. The covering is fastened
to the ground by curved pieces of bone, being generally parts of the
whale.</p>

<p>This kind of tent differs from the one described by me only in the
construction of its door.</p>

<p>I could not find a description of the tent of the Hudson Bay Eskimo.
There is only one illustration in Klutschak (p.&nbsp;137) and one in
Ross (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;581) representing tents of the Netchillirmiut. In
the former there are a few conical tents, such as are used by the
eastern tribes before a sufficient number of skins for a large tent can
be
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page553" id =
"page553">553</a></span>
procured. The same kind is represented in Ross’s book. The other tent
drawn by Klutschak is similar to the Iglulik one, but the arrangement of
the poles in the back part is invisible. The entrance is formed by two
converging poles and a rope runs over the ridge and is tied to a
rock.</p>

<p>The small tents which are used in the spring are made of a few
converging poles forming a cone. They are covered with a skin roof.</p>

<p>Some families, instead of building snow houses or stone houses in
winter, cover the summer tent with shrubs and spread over them a second
skin cover. In front of the tent snow vaults are built to protect the
interior from the cold. In some instances several families join their
tents (Fig. 506). In the front part where the tents adjoin each other
the covers are taken away and replaced by a whale rib which affords a
passage from one room to the other.</p>

<h4><a name = "habit_dress" id = "habit_dress">CLOTHING, DRESSING OF THE
HAIR, AND TATTOOING.</a></h4>

<p>The styles of clothing differ among the tribes of the Central Eskimo.
In summer the outer garment is always made of sealskins, though the
women wear deerskins almost the entire year. The sealskin clothing is
made from the skins of <i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>, yearlings being used, and
also from those of <i>Callocephalus</i>, if they can be obtained. The
latter particularly are highly valued by the natives. The inner garment
is made either of the skin of the young seal in the white coat or of a
light deerskin. It is cut entirely with the woman’s knife and is sewed
with deer sinews.</p>

<p>The prettiest clothing is made by the tribes of Davis Strait. Both
men and women wear boots, trousers, and jackets. The style of the men’s
clothing may be seen from Figs. <a href = "#fig397">397</a> and <a href
= "#fig399">399</a>, which represent men in the winter clothing, and
<a href = "#fig412">412</a> and <a href = "#fig435">435</a>, which show
them in summer clothing. The summer boots are made from the hairless
skin of <i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>, the soles from that of <i>Phoca</i>, the
sole reaching to the top of the foot. The leg of the boot is kept up by
a string passing through its rim and firmly tied around the leg. At the
ankle a string passes over the instep and around the foot to prevent the
heel from slipping down. On the top of the foot a knob (qaturang) is
sometimes attached to the string as an ornament (Fig. 507). The stocking
is made of light deerskin. It reaches above the knee, where it has a
trimming made from the white parts of a deerskin, whereas the boot ends
below the knee. Next to the stocking is a slipper, which is made of
birdskin, the feathers being worn next to the foot. This is covered with
a slipper of sealskin, the hair side worn outward and the hair pointing
toward the heel. The boot finishes the footgear. In the huts the
birdskin slippers are frequently laid aside.</p>

<p>The breeches of the men consist of an outside and an inside pair, the
former being worn with the hair outside; the latter, which are made of
the skins of young seals or of deer, with the hair inside. They are
fastened round the body by means of a string and reach a little below
the knee. Their make will best be seen from the figures. Only the
southern tribes trim the lower end of the trousers by sewing a piece to
them, the hair of which runs around the leg, while above it runs
downward. This pattern looks very pretty.</p>

<p>The jacket does not open in front, but is drawn over the head. It
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page555" id =
"page555">555</a></span>
has a hood fitting closely to the head. The back and the front are made
of a sealskin each. The hood of the Oqomiut is sharply pointed, while
that of the Akudnirmiut is more rounded. The jackets are cut straight
and have a slit in front. Some have a short tail behind, particularly
the winter jackets. The cut of the winter clothing, which is made of
deerskin, is the same as the former, and it is frequently trimmed with
straps of deerskin. The jacket is rarely worn with the hood down, as it
is only used while hunting and traveling. It is never brought into the
huts, but after being cleaned from the adhering snow with the snowbeater
(tiluqtung, as named by the eastern
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page556" id =
"page556">556</a></span>
tribes; arautaq, as called by Hudson Bay tribes) is kept in the
storeroom outside the house.</p>

<p>The women’s trousers are composed of two pieces. The upper one fits
tightly and covers the upper half of the thigh. It is made of the skin
of a deer’s belly. The other parts are, as it were, leggings, which
reach from a little below the knee to the middle of the thigh and are
kept in place by a string running to the upper part of the trousers. The
women’s jacket (Fig. 508) is much more neatly trimmed than that of the
men. It is frequently adorned with ivory or brass beads running round
the edge (Fig. 509). It has a wide and large hood reaching down almost
to the middle of the body. In front the jacket has a short appendage;
behind, a&nbsp;very long tail which trails along the ground (see Fig.
508). If a child is carried in the hood, a&nbsp;leather girdle fastened
with a buckle (Fig. 510) is tied around the waist and serves to prevent
the child from slipping down. The first specimen given in Fig. 510 is
remarkable for its artistic design.</p>

<p>Among the Akudnirmiut of Davis Strait another fashion is more
frequently in use much resembling that of Iglulik. The women have a
wider jacket with a broader hood, enormous boots with a flap reaching up
to the hip, and breeches consisting of one piece and reaching to the
knees. Unfortunately I have no drawing of this clothing and must
therefore refer to Parry’s engravings, which, however, are not very well
executed, and to the figures representing dolls in this costume (see
<a href = "#fig528">Fig.&nbsp;528</a>).</p>

<p>When children are about a month old they are put into a jacket made
from the skin of a deer fawn and a cap of the same material, their legs
remaining bare, as they are always carried in their mother’s
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page557" id =
"page557">557</a></span>
hood. In some places, where large boots are in use, they are said to be
carried in these. The cap is separate and is always made of the head of
a fawn, the ears standing upright on each side of the head. The jacket
is either quite open in front or has a short slit. Children of more than
two years of age wear the same clothing, with trousers and boots (Fig.
511). When they are about eight years old they are clothed like men
(Fig. 512). Girls frequently wear the same kind of dress for some time,
until they are from nine to ten years old, when they assume the clothing
of the women.</p>

<p>As to the mode of clothing of the other tribes I give the
descriptions of the authors.</p>

<p>Parry describes the dress of the Iglulirmiut as follows (II,
p.&nbsp;495):</p>

<p class = "quote">
In the jacket of the women, the tail or flap behind is very broad, and
so long as almost to touch the ground; while a shorter and narrower one
before reaches halfway down the thigh. The men have also a tail in the
hind part of their jacket, but of smaller dimensions; but before, it is
generally straight or ornamented by a single scollop. The hood of the
jacket &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>is much the largest in
that of the women, for the purpose of holding a child. The back of the

strap or girdle below this, and secured round the waist by two large
wooden buttons in front, prevents the infant from falling through when,

and uniform pattern, and sewed with exceeding neatness, which is the
case with all the dresses of these people, has also the flaps ornamented
in a very becoming manner by a neat border of deerskin, so arranged as
to display alternate breadths of white and dark fur. This is, moreover,
usually beautified by a handsome fringe, consisting of innumerable long,
narrow threads of leather hanging down from it.<a class = "tag" name =

uncommon also in the outer jackets of the men. When seal-hunting,<a
class = "tag" href = "#endnoteA">A</a> they fasten up the tails of their
jackets with a button behind.</p>

<p>The breeches and the foot gear of the men are described as being much
the same as those of the Akudnirmiut. Parry remarks (loc. cit.) that
several serpentine pieces of hide are sewed across the soles to prevent
them from wearing out:</p>

<p class = "quote">
The inner boot of the women, unlike that of the men, is loose around the
leg, coming as high as the knee joint behind, and in front carried up by
a long, pointed flap nearly to the waist and there fastened to the
breeches. The upper boot, with the hair as usual outside, corresponds
with the other in shape, except that it is much more full, especially on
the outer side, where it bulges out so preposterously as to give the
women the most awkward, bow-legged appearance imaginable. &nbsp;<span
class = "emspace">***</span>Here, also, as in the jacket, considerable
taste is displayed in the selection of different parts of the deerskin,
alternate strips of dark and white being placed up and down the sides
and front by way of ornament. The women also wear a moccasin (itigega)
overall in the winter-time.</p>

<p>The dress of the Aivillirmiut is similar to that of the Igiulirmiut
(Gilder, p.&nbsp;139).</p>

<p>Traces of clothing found in old graves of Cumberland Sound and
Frobisher’s description of the dress of the Nugumiut show that the style
of clothing now used by the Igiulirmiut formerly obtained in all parts
of Baffin Land.</p>

<p>All the Eskimo wear mittens. Those used in winter are made of the
skin of young seals or of deerskin. In summer they use hairless
sealskin, and sometimes make them with two thumbs, so as to turn the
mitten round if one side should become wet.</p>

<p>The manner of dressing the hair practiced by the tribes of
Northeastern Baffin Land differs from that of other tribes. On Davis
Strait and in Hudson Bay the men allow it to grow to a considerable
length, but frequently cut it short on the forehead. If all the hair is
long it is kept back by a band made of the skin of deer antlers taken in
the velvet. Sometimes these ties are very neatly finished. Frobisher
states that the Nugumiut shaved part of their heads. The Kinipetu shave
the top of the head; the Netchillirmiut wear their hair short.</p>

<p>The women have two styles of dressing their hair. They always part it
on the top of the head. The back hair is wound into a bunch protruding
from the back of the head or nicely arranged in a knot. The hair at the
sides is plaited and folded over the ears, joining the knot behind. The
other way is to arrange these parts in small pigtails reaching a little
below the ears. They are kept in order by an ivory or brass ring (see
<a href = "#fig515">Fig.&nbsp;515</a>).</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page559" id =
"page559">559</a></span>
<p>The manner in which the Iglulirmiut dress their hair is thus
described by Parry (II, p.&nbsp;493):</p>

<p class = "quote">
They separate their locks into two equal parts, one of which hangs on
each side of their heads and in front of their shoulders. To stiffen and
bind these they use a narrow strap of deerskin, attached at one end to a
round piece of bone, fourteen inches long, tapered to a point, and
covered over with leather. This looks like a little whip, the handle of
which is placed up and down the hair and the strap wound round it in a
number of spiral turns, making the tail, thus equipped, very much
resemble one of those formerly worn by our seamen. The strap of this
article of dress, which is altogether called a tugliga, is so made from
the deerskin as to show when bound round the hair, alternate turns of
white and dark fur, which give it a very neat and ornamental appearance.
&nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>Those who are less nice dispose

<p>The natives of Southampton Island arrange their hair in a bunch

certain feasts on Davis Strait (<a href =

<p>For dressing the hair ivory combs are in use, two specimens of which
are represented in. Fig. 513.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page560" id =

adorned with ivory beads. Instead of these, teeth, deer’s ears, foxes’
noses, or brass bells are sometimes used.</p>

<p>The inner jackets of the men are sometimes trimmed with beads,
feathers, or leather straps, forming a collar and figures of different
kinds on the back and on the breast. An amulet is worn in the middle of

<p>The women are in the habit of adorning their faces by tattooing. It
is done, when they are about twelve years of age, by passing needle and
thread covered with soot under the skin, or by puncture, the points of
the tattooing instruments being rubbed with the same substance in both
cases, which is a mixture of the juice of <i>Fucus</i> and soot, or with
gunpowder, by which process they obtain a blue color. The face, arms,
hands, thighs, and breasts are the parts of the body which are generally
tattooed. The patterns will be seen in Figs. 515 and 516.</p>

<p>It is winter and the natives are established in their warm snow
houses. At this time of the year it is necessary to make use of the
short daylight and twilight for hunting. Long before the day begins to
dawn the Eskimo prepares for hunting. He rouses his housemates; his wife
supplies the lamp with a new wick and fresh blubber
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page562" id =
"page562">562</a></span>
and the dim light which has been kept burning during the night quickly
brightens up and warms the hut. While the woman is busy preparing
breakfast the man fits up his sledge for hunting. He takes the snow
block which closes the entrance of the dwelling room during the night
out of the doorway and passes through the low passages. Within the
passage the dogs are sleeping, tired by the fatigues of the day before.
Though their long, heavy hair protects them from the severe cold of the
Arctic winter, they like to seek shelter from the piercing winds in the
entrance of the hut.</p>

<p>The sledge is iced, the harnesses are taken out of the storeroom by
the door, and the dogs are harnessed to the sledge. Breakfast is now
ready and after having taken a hearty meal of seal soup and frozen and
cooked seal meat the hunter lashes the spear that stands outside of the
hut upon the sledge, hangs the harpoon line, some toggles, and his knife
over the antlers, and starts for the hunting ground. Here he waits
patiently for the blowing seal, sometimes until late in the evening.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the women, who stay at home, are engaged in their domestic
occupations, mending boots and making new clothing, or they visit one
another, taking some work with them, or pass their time with games or in
playing with the children. While sitting at their sewing and at the same
time watching their lamps and cooking the meat, they incessantly hum
their favorite tunes. About noon they cook their dinner and usually
prepare at the same time the meal for the returning hunters. As soon as
the first sledge is heard approaching, the pots, which have been pushed
back during the afternoon, are placed over the fire, and when the hungry
men enter the hut their dinner is ready. While hunting they usually open
the seals caught early in the morning, to take out a piece of the flesh
or liver, which they eat raw, for lunch. The cut is then temporarily
fastened until the final dressing of the animal at home.</p>

<p>In the western regions particularly the hunters frequently visit the
depots of venison made in the fall, and the return is always followed by
a great feast.</p>

<p>After the hunters reach home they first unharness their dogs and
unstring the traces, which are carefully arranged, coiled up, and put
away in the storeroom. Then the sledge is unloaded and the spoils are
dragged through the entrance into the hut. A&nbsp;religious custom
commands the women to leave off working, and not until the seal is cut
up are they allowed to resume their sewing and the preparing of skins.
This custom is founded on the tradition that all kinds of sea animals
have risen from the fingers of their supreme goddess, who must be
propitiated after being offended by the murder of her offspring (see
<a href = "#page583">p.&nbsp;583</a>). The spear is stuck into the snow at
the entrance of the house, the sledge is turned upside down, and the ice
coating is removed from the runners. Then it is leaned against the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page563" id =
"page563">563</a></span>
wall of the house, and at last the hunter is ready to enter. He strips
off his deerskin jacket and slips into his sealskin coat. The former is
carefully cleaned of the adhering ice and snow with the snowbeater and
put into the storeroom outside the house.</p>

<p>This done, the men are ready for their dinner, of which the women do
not partake. In winter the staple food of the Eskimo is boiled seal and
walrus meat, though in some parts of the western districts it is musk ox
and venison, a&nbsp;rich and nourishing soup being obtained by cooking
the meat. The natives are particularly fond of seal and walrus soup,
which is made by mixing and boiling water, blood, and blubber with large
pieces of meat.</p>

<p>The food is not always salted, but sometimes melted sea water ice,
which contains a sufficient quantity of salt, is used for cooking. Liver
is generally eaten raw and is considered a tidbit. I&nbsp;have seen the
intestines eaten only when there was no meat.</p>

<p>Forks (Fig. 517)<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a> are used to take the meat out of the kettle and the soup
is generally poured out into a large cup. Before the introduction of
European manufactures these vessels and dishes generally consisted of
whalebone. One of these has been described by Parry
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;286). It was circular in form, one piece of whalebone
being bent into the proper shape for the sides and another flat piece of
the same material sewed to it for a bottom, so closely as to make it
perfectly watertight. A&nbsp;ladle or spoon (Fig. 518) is sometimes used
in drinking it, but usually the cup is passed around, each taking a sip
in turn. In the same way large pieces of meat are passed round, each
taking as large a mouthful as possible and then cutting
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page564" id =
"page564">564</a></span>
off the bit close to the lips. They all smack their lips in eating. The
Eskimo drink a great deal of water, which is generally kept in vessels
standing near the lamps. When the men have finished their meal the women
take their share, and then all attack the frozen meat which is kept in
the storerooms. The women are allowed to participate in this part of the
meal. An enormous quantity of meat is devoured every night, and
sometimes they only suspend eating when they go to bed, keeping a piece
of meat within reach in case they awake.</p>

<p>After dinner the seals, which have been placed behind the lamps to
thaw, are thrown upon the floor, cut up, and the spare meat and skins
are taken into the storerooms. If a scarcity of food prevails in the
village and a hunter has caught a few seals, every inhabitant of the
settlement receives a piece of meat and blubber, which he takes to his
hut, and the successful hunter invites all hands to a feast.</p>

<p>The dogs are fed every second day after dinner. For this purpose two
men go to a place at a short distance from the hut, taking the frozen
food with them, which they split with a hatchet or the point of the
spear. While one is breaking the solid mass the other keeps the dogs off
by means of the whip, but as soon as the food is ready they make a rush
at it, and in less than half a minute have swallowed their meal. No dog
of a strange team is allowed to steal anything, but is kept at a
distance by the dogs themselves and by the whip. If the dogs are very
hungry they are harnessed to the sledge in order to prevent an attack
before the men are ready. They are unharnessed after the food is
prepared, the weakest first, in order to give him the best chance of
picking out some good pieces. Sometimes they are fed in the house; in
such a case, the food being first prepared, they are led into the hut
singly; thus each receives his share.</p>

<p>All the work being finished, boots and stockings are changed, as they
must be dried and mended. The men visit one another and spend the night
in talking, singing, gambling, and telling stories. The events of the
day are talked over, success in hunting is compared, the hunting tools
requiring mending are set in order, and the lines are dried and
softened. Some busy themselves in cutting new ivory implements and seal
lines or in carving. They never spend the nights quite alone, but meet
for social entertainment. During these visits the host places a large
lump of frozen meat and a knife on the side bench behind the lamp and
every one is welcome to help himself to as much as he likes.</p>

<p>The first comers sit down on the ledge, while those entering later
stand or squat in the passage. When any one addresses the whole assembly
he always turns his face to the wall and avoids facing the listeners.
Most of the men take off their outer jacket in the house and they sit
chatting until very late. Even the young children do not go to bed
early.</p>

<p>The women sit on the bed in front of their lamps, with their legs
under them, working continually on their own clothing or on that of the
men, drying the wet footgear and mittens, and softening the leather by
chewing and rubbing. If a bitch has a litter of pups it is their
business to look after them, to keep them warm, and to feed them
regularly. Generally the pups are put into a small harness and are
allowed to crawl about the side of the bed, where they are tied to the
wall by a trace. Young children are always carried in their mothers’
hoods, but when about a year and a half old they are
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page566" id =
"page566">566</a></span>
allowed to play on the bed, and are only carried by their mothers when
they get too mischievous. When the mother is engaged in any hard work
they are carried by the young girls. They are weaned when about two
years old, but women suckle them occasionally until they are three or
four years of age. During this time they are frequently fed from their
mothers’ mouths. When about twelve years old they begin to help their
parents, the girls sewing and preparing skins, the boys accompanying
their fathers in hunting expeditions. The parents are very fond of their
children and treat them kindly. They are never beaten and rarely
scolded, and in turn they are very dutiful, obeying the wishes of their
parents and taking care of them in their old age.</p>

<p>In winter gambling is one of the favorite amusements of the Eskimo.
Figs. 519&ndash;521 represent the ajegaung, used in a game somewhat
similar to our cup and ball. The most primitive device is Fig. 519,
a&nbsp;hare’s skull with a number of holes drilled through it.
A&nbsp;specimen was kindly lent to me by Lucien M. Turner, who brought
it from Ungava Bay; but in Baffin Land exactly the same device is in
use. Fig. 520 represents the head of a fox, in ivory; Fig. 521,
a&nbsp;polar bear. The specimen shown in Fig. 521&nbsp;<i>b</i> was
brought from Cumberland Sound by Kumlien. The neck of the bear is more
elaborate than the one shown in <i>a</i>. The attachment of the part
representing the hind legs is of some interest. The game is played as
follows: First, the skull or the piece of ivory must be thrown up and
caught ten times upon the stick in any one of the holes. Then, beginning
with the hole in front (the mouth), those of the middle line must be
caught. The three holes on the neck of the bear are double, one crossing
vertically, the other slanting backward, but both ending in one hole on
the neck. After the mouth has been caught upon the stick the vertical
hole in the neck is the next, then the oblique one, and so on down the
middle line of the animal’s body. If, in the first part of the game, the
player misses twice he must give up the pieces to his neighbor, who then
takes his turn. In the second part he is allowed to play on as long as
he catches in any hole, even if it be not the right one, but as soon as
he misses he must give it up. After having caught one hole he proceeds
to the next, and the player who first finishes all the holes has won the
game.</p>

<p>A game similar to dice, called tingmiujang, i.e., images of birds, is
frequently played. A&nbsp;set of about fifteen figures like those
represented in Fig. 522 belong to this game, some representing birds,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page568" id =
"page568">568</a></span>
others men or women. The players sit around a board or a piece of
leather and the figures are shaken in the hand and thrown upward. On
falling, some stand upright, others lie flat on the back or on the side.
Those standing upright belong to that player whom they face; sometimes
they are so thrown that they all belong to the one who tossed them up.
The players throw by turns until the last figure is taken up, the one
getting the greatest number of the figures being the winner.</p>

<p>A favorite game is the nuglutang (Fig. 523). A small, rhomboidal
plate of ivory with a hole in the center is hung from the roof and
steadied by a heavy stone or a piece of ivory hanging from its lower
end. The Eskimo stand around it and when the winner of the last game
gives a signal every one tries to hit the hole with a stick. The one who
succeeds has won. This game is always played amid great excitement.</p>

<p>Their way of managing the gain and loss is very curious. The first
winner in the game must go to his hut and fetch anything he likes as a

anything is the first winner of the game, while the only one who wins

<p>The women are particularly fond of making figures out of a loop,
a&nbsp;game similar to our cat’s cradle (ajarorpoq). They are, however,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page570" id =

much more clever than we in handling the thong and have a great variety

representing a deer (Fig. 525&nbsp;<i>a</i>): Wind the loop over both
hands, passing it over the back of the thumbs inside the palms and
outside the fourth fingers. Take the string from the palm of the right
hand with the first finger of the left and vice versa. The first finger
of the right hand moves over all the parts of the thong lying on the
first and fourth fingers of the right hand and passes through the loop
formed by the thongs on the thumb of the right hand; then it moves back
over the foremost thong and takes it up, while the thumb lets go the
loop. The first finger moves downward before the thongs lying on the
fourth finger and comes up in front of all the thongs. The thumb is
placed into the loops hanging on the first finger and the loop hanging
on the first finger of the left hand is drawn through both and hung
again over the same finger. The thumb and first finger of the right and
the thumb of the left hand let go their loops. The whole is then drawn
tight. A&nbsp;few other devices from Hudson Bay are represented by
Klutschak (p.&nbsp;139).</p>

<p>The ball (Fig. 526) is most frequently used in summer. It is made of
sealskin stuffed with moss and neatly trimmed with skin straps. One man
throws the ball among the players, whose object it is to keep it always
in motion without allowing it to touch the ground. Another game of ball
I have seen played by men only. A&nbsp;leather ball filled with hard
clay is propelled with a whip, the lash of which is tied up in a coil.
Every man has his whip and is to hit the ball and so prevent his fellow
players from getting at it.</p>

<p>A third game at ball called igdlukitaqtung is played with small balls
tossed up alternately from the right to the left, one always being in
the air. Songs used in the game will be found in the last pages of this
paper.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page571" id =

<p>An amusement of women and children is to point successively on the
forehead, the cheek, and the chin and to pronounce as rapidly as
possible sulubautiχu´tika, tudliχu´tika, tadliχu´tika, tudliχú´tika,
i.e., the forehead, the cheek, the chin, the cheek.</p>

<p>Young children play with toy sledges, kayaks, boats, bows and arrows,
and dolls. The last are made in the same way by all the tribes,
a&nbsp;wooden body being clothed with scraps of deerskin cut in the same
way as the clothing of men. Fig. 527 shows dolls in the dress of the

<p>In summer children and grown up people exercise by sitting down on
their knees in a large circle and simultaneously jumping up and down, by
kneeling and holding their toes in their hands and trying to outdo one
another in running in this position, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A favorite amusement during the long winter nights is telling tales
and composing songs. Old traditions are always related in a highly
ceremonious manner. The narrator takes off his outer jacket, pulls the
hood over his head, and sits down in the rear part of the hut, turning
his face toward the wall, and then tells the story slowly and solemnly.
All the stories are related in a very abridged form, the substance being
supposed to be known. The form is always the same, and should the
narrator happen to say one word otherwise than is customary he will be
corrected by the listeners.</p>

<p>Children tell one another fables and sing short songs. Comic songs
making fun of any person are great favorites. Details on the poetry and
music of the Eskimo will be found further on.</p>

<p>Parry’s description of the games and sports practiced by the
Iglulirmiut is so interesting that I insert it here
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;538):</p>

<p class = "quote">
On an occasion when most of the men were absent from the huts on a
sealing excursion, the women joined in playing, one of them being the
chief performer. Being requested to amuse the rest, she suddenly unbound
her hair, platted it, tied both ends together to keep it out of her way,
and then stepping out into the middle of the hut, began to make the most
hideous faces that can be conceived, by drawing both lips into her
mouth, poking forward her chin, squinting frightfully, occasionally
shutting one eye, and moving her head from side to side as if her neck
had been dislocated. This exhibition, which they call ajokitarpoq, and
which is evidently considered an accomplishment that few of them possess
in perfection, distorts every feature in the most horrible manner
imaginable, and would, I&nbsp;think, put our most skillful horse-collar
grinners quite out of countenance.</p>

<p>This performance is identical with one described later (<a href =
"#page578">p.&nbsp;578</a>) as practiced during the meals in summer.</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>The next performance consists in looking steadfastly and gravely
forward and repeating the words tăbā’-tăbā’; kjaibo, kjaibo; kebang
inutovik, kebang inutovik; amatama, amatama, in the order in which they
are here placed, but each at least four times, and always by a peculiar
modulation of the voice speaking them in pairs as they are coupled
above. The sound is made to proceed from the throat in a way much
resembling ventriloquism, to which art it is indeed an approach. After
the last amatama she always pointed with her finger toward her body, and
pronounced the word angakoq, steadily retaining her gravity for five or
six seconds, and then bursting into a loud laugh, in which she was
joined by all the rest. The women sometimes produce a much more guttural
and unnatural sound, repeating principally the word ikeri-ikeri,
coupling them as before, and staring in such a manner as to make their
eyes appear ready to burst out of their sockets with the exertion. Two
or more of them will sometimes stand up face to face, and with great
quickness and regularity respond to each other, keeping such exact time
that the sound appears to come from one throat instead of several. Very
few of the females are possessed of this accomplishment, which is called
pitkusiraqpoq, and it is not uncommon to see several of the younger
females practising it. A&nbsp;third part of the game, distinguished by
the word kaitikpoq, consists only in falling on each knee alternately,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page573" id =
"page573">573</a></span>
a&nbsp;piece of agility which they perform with tolerable quickness,
considering the bulky and awkward nature of their dress. &nbsp;<span
class = "emspace">***</span>Then the same woman came forward, and
letting her arms hang down loosely and bending her body very much
forward, shook herself with extreme violence, as if her whole frame had
been strongly convulsed, uttering at the same time, in a wild tone of
voice, some of the unnatural sounds before mentioned.</p>

<p>This being at an end, a new exhibition was commenced in which ten or
twelve women took a part, and which our gentlemen compared to blind
man’s buff. A&nbsp;circle being formed, and a boy dispatched to look out
at the door of the hut, a&nbsp;woman placed herself in the center, and,
after making a variety of guttural noises for about half a minute, shut
her eyes, and ran about till she had taken hold of one of the others,
whose business it then became to take her station in the center, so that
almost every woman in her turn occupied this post, and in her own
peculiar way, either by distortion of countenance or other gestures,
performed her part in the game. This continued three-quarters of an
hour, and, from the precaution of placing a lookout who was withdrawn
when it was over, as well as from some very expressive signs which need
not here be mentioned, there is reason to believe that it is usually
followed by certain indecencies, with which their husbands are not to be
acquainted. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span></p>

<p>The most common amusement however, and to which their husbands made
no objection, they performed at Winter Island expressly for our
gratification. The females, being collected to the number of ten or
twelve, stood in as large a circle as the hut would admit, with a man in
the center. He began by a sort of half howling, half singing noise,
which appeared as if designed to call the attention of the women, the
latter soon commencing the Amna Aya song. This they continued without
variety, remaining quite still while the man walked round within the
circle; his body was rather bent forward, his eyes sometimes closed, his
arms constantly moving up and down, and now and then hoarsely
vociferating a word or two as if to increase the animation of the
singers, who, whenever he did this, quitted the chorus and rose into the
words of the song. At the end of ten minutes they all left off at once,
and after one minute’s interval commenced a second act precisely similar
and of equal duration, the man continuing to invoke their muse as
before. A&nbsp;third act which followed this, varied frequently towards
the close only in his throwing his feet up before and clapping his hands
together, by which exertion he was thrown into a violent perspiration.
He then retired, desiring a young man (who as we were informed was the
only individual of several then present thus qualified) to take his
place in the center as master of the ceremonies, when the same antics as
before were again gone through. After this description it will scarcely
be necessary to remark that nothing can be poorer in its way than this
tedious singing recreation, which, as well as in everything in which
dancing is concerned, they express by the word mumipoq. They seem,
however, to take great delight in it; and even a number of the men as
well as all the children crept into the hut by degrees to peep at the
performance.</p>

<p>The Eskimo women and children often amuse themselves with a game not
unlike our “skip-rope.” This is performed by two women holding the ends
of a line and whirling it regularly round and round, while a third jumps
over it in the middle according to the following order. She commences by
jumping twice on both feet, then alternately with the right and left,
and next four times with the feet slipped one behind the other, the rope
passing once round at each jump. After this she performs a circle on the
ground, jumping about half a dozen times in the course of it, which
bringing her to her original position, the same thing is repeated as
often as it can be done without entangling the line. One or two of the
women performed this with considerable agility and adroitness,
considering the clumsiness of their boots and jackets, and seemed to
pride themselves in some degree on the qualification.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page574" id =
"page574">574</a></span>
A&nbsp;second kind of this game consists in two women holding a long
rope by its ends and whirling it round in such a manner over the heads
of two others standing close together near the middle of the bight, that
each of these shall jump over it alternately. The art therefore, which
is indeed considerable, depends more on those whirling the rope than on
the jumpers, who are, however, obliged to keep exact time in order to be
ready for the rope passing under their feet.</p>
</div>

<p>Of all these games I observed only the one called pitkusiraqpoq by
Parry, which I saw played several times at Cumberland Sound. (See
Appendix, <a href = "#app3">Note&nbsp;3</a>.)</p>

<p class = "space">
While in times of plenty the home life is quite cheerful, the house
presents a sad and gloomy appearance if stormy weather prevents the men
from hunting. The stores are quickly consumed, one lamp after another is
extinguished, and everybody sits motionless in the dark hut.
Nevertheless the women and men do not stop humming their monotonous amna
aya and their stoicism in enduring the pangs of hunger is really
wonderful. At last, when starvation is menacing the sufferers, the most
daring of the men resolves to try his luck. Though the storm may rage
over the icy plain he sets out to go sealing. For hours he braves the
cold and stands waiting and watching at the breathing hole until he
hears the blowing of the seal and succeeds in killing it.</p>

<p>When those who have remained at home hear the sound of the returning
sledge, they rush out of the houses to meet it. Quickly they help the
bold hunter to get on shore. The sledge is unloaded, the seal dragged
into the house, and every one joyfully awaits his share. The animal is
cut up, every household receiving a piece of meat and blubber. The
gloomy huts are again lighted up and the pots, which had been out of use
for some days, are again hung up over the lamps.</p>

<p>If the hunter, however, has tried in vain to procure food, if the
storm does not subside, the terrors of famine visit the settlement. The
dogs are the first to fall victims to the pressing hunger, and if the
worst comes cannibalism is resorted to. But all these occurrences are
spoken of with the utmost horror. In such cases children particularly
are killed and eaten. Fortunately, however, such occurrences are very
rare.</p>


<h4><a name = "social_visit" id = "social_visit">VISITING.</a></h4>

<p>As soon as the ice has consolidated in winter a lively intercourse
springs up between the settlements. Friends visit one another, trading
excursions are undertaken, and almost every few days visitors arrive at
the village. They are welcomed with great hospitality. The sledge is
unloaded and the dogs are fed by the host. The visitor is led into the
hut, served with the choicest pieces of meat, and the hostess puts his
clothing in order. In the winter these visits are generally short,
rarely lasting more than a few days.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page575" id =
"page575">575</a></span>
<p>Longer journeys are postponed until spring, when food can be procured
more easily. These journeys are planned a long time before they are
made. While the families generally leave what they can spare of their
household goods in winter at their summer settlement, they bring away
everything they possess to the winter village if they intend to visit a
neighboring tribe in the spring. In April or May they leave their snow
houses; the tent poles and the whole of their goods are loaded upon the
sledge, only the boats being left behind in charge of some friend, and
then they start upon their long, lonely journey. On the first day they
do not travel far, but make the first halt after about a twelve-mile
journey. As the load is heavy the men and women sit on the top of the
sledges only to rest. The driver walks alongside and the women lead the
way, the dogs pulling more willingly if they see somebody ahead of the
sledge. At night it is not unloaded, only those things being taken out
which are necessary for building a small tent and for cooking. In order
to protect the sledge from the attacks of the dogs, the pitu (see
<a href = "#page530">p.&nbsp;530</a>) is taken out and fastened to an eye
cut into the ice with the end of the spear. After having traveled about
three days a longer halt is made; the sledge is unloaded, the dogs are
unharnessed, and the men go out hunting in order to procure food for the
dogs and for themselves. Thus they slowly proceed until they at last
reach the end of their journey. Here they settle down with the friends
whom they have come to visit, establish a hut of their own, and spend a
whole year with them. In the following spring they retrace their journey
to their own homes. Journeys of four to five hundred miles in one spring
are not of rare occurrence; longer journeys, however, frequently last
for years.</p>

<p>A journey of two hundred miles, going and coming, is sometimes
accomplished in one season. For such a journey they would set out in
March or April, leaving all their goods behind, and live with the
friends whom they visit for a month or two, returning about June. While
on the visit the visitors help their friends to provide for their
families.</p>

<p>In traveling in the spring the Eskimo always use snow goggles to
protect themselves from snow blindness. The modern ones (Fig. 529),
which are made of wood and have a shade and a narrow slit for each eye,
are very effective. The old design is represented in Fig. 530, the
specimen being made of ivory.</p>

<p>Long journeys are sometimes made in summer, several families
traveling together in their boats. As, however, the open season is very
short in many parts of Northeastern America, spring journeys are more
frequently made.</p>

<p>When traveling by boat the tent poles, skin covers, and all the
household goods are stowed away in the bottom. The women do the pulling,
three or four working at each oar, while a man sits on the stern board
steering with a paddle. They move on at their leisure,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page576" id =
"page576">576</a></span>
stopping whenever they are tired or when a seal is seen blowing near the
boat. The kayaks are tied to the stern and towed along. Children and
dogs lie about in the bottom of the boat. In the center there is a tub
containing all kinds of provisions, and every now and then they take
some refreshment from it. During the nights the tents are erected at
suitable points. The natives are well acquainted with these, and, if
they are not compelled by severe weather to seek shelter at the nearest
point, always visit the same places. These have a smooth, sloping beach,
fresh water, and dry, gravelly places in which the tents are built.</p>


<h4><a name = "social_summer" id = "social_summer">SOCIAL CUSTOMS IN
SUMMER.</a></h4>

<p>When the rays of the sun begin to be warmer and the roofs of the snow
houses tumble down the natives live in a very uncomfortable way until a
sufficient number of sealskins are procured to build a tent. Sometimes a
family live under a roof too small to cover them
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page577" id =
"page577">577</a></span>
all, though they sit as close as possible, and too low to permit them to
sit upright; but, as seals are basking everywhere on the ice, this state
of affairs does not last long. The women split a number of large skins
and dry them on the snow, and by the middle of May they can build a
pretty large tent; but it is not until they settle permanently at the
place of the summer village that the large tent is sewed and put up.</p>

<p>At this season salmon and venison form the staple food of the Eskimo.
The old men, women, and children, who stay at the lakes or at the salmon
rivers, depend almost entirely upon this food. They fish and eat the
salmon in a raw as well as in a cooked state. Birds are caught and eaten
raw. The surplus salmon are split and dried on poles erected for the
purpose. Deer shoulders, legs, and backs are also cut into thin pieces
and dried. Sometimes the dried fish and venison are deposited in stone
caches for later use, but most of it is eaten in summer, especially when
the Eskimo go traveling. When the men go deer hunting they take a supply
of dried salmon with them, and thus can stay out for a week or even
longer. When a deer is killed it is skinned at once, the legs being slit
and the belly opened. The paunch is carefully tied up, as the contents
are a favorite dish of the Eskimo. The head, the legs, and the ribs are
cut off and after being piled up the whole is covered with heavy stones,
only the horns protruding from the top of the depot. The hams and the
skin are generally carried to the hut at once, and, if the distance is
not too great or the carcass can be reached with sledges or boats, the
whole animal is brought home. Large depots are only made in the fall,
when there is no danger of the meat spoiling.</p>

<p>At this season the natives visit deer passes and lakes, near which
they establish their huts. The tents and all the household goods are
packed up in heavy bundles, some of which are carried by the dogs, the
load hanging on both sides of the back; others, by men and women, being
secured by one strap which passes over the forehead and by another which
passes over the breast. Their strength and their perseverance in
carrying heavy loads over long distances are remarkable.</p>

<p>The social life in the summer settlements is rather different from
that in winter. At this season the families do not cook their own meals,
but a single one provides for the whole settlement. The day before it is
her turn to cook, the woman goes to the hills to fetch shrubs for the
fire. Three stones are put up near the hut as a fireplace, the opening
facing the wind. The kettle is placed on the top of it and the fire is
fed with shrubs and blubber. When the meal is ready the master of the
house stands beside it, crying Ujo! Ujo! (boiled meat) and everybody
comes out of the hut provided with a knife. The dish is carried to a
level place and the men sit down around it in one circle, while the
women form another. Then large
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page578" id =
"page578">578</a></span>
lumps of meat are passed around, everybody cutting off a piece and
taking a swallow of the soup, which is passed around in a large leather
cup. These dinners, which are held in the evening after the return from
the hunt, are almost always enlivened by a mimic performance. A&nbsp;man
or an old woman sits down in the center of the circle and amuses the
assembly by singing and dancing or by making faces. A&nbsp;favorite
performance is one in which a man, with blackened face and with a thong
tied around his head, writhes and makes odd grimaces.</p>

<p>After dinner the men sit chatting or gambling before the huts, while
the women and children amuse themselves by running about, playing at
ball, or dancing.</p>

<p>A strict religious custom forbids the Eskimo to work on the deerskins
which are obtained in summer before the ice has formed; they are only
dried and tied up in large bundles. In the fall, when on their way to
the winter settlements, the Eskimo travel rather quickly. The boats are
piled up with the spoils of the summer hunt and the place of destination
is generally reached before the stormy weather sets in.</p>

<p>When it gets colder short excursions are made by boat in order to
collect shrubs for covering the tents. Several families join in building
a common hut, and on a fine day the old tents are torn down and the tent
poles are converted into a strong frame, which is covered with a double
roof. The bed and the platforms for the lamps are raised and henceforth
all the cooking is done inside.</p>

<p>As soon as the first seals are caught with the harpoon the deer skins
are prepared. If they were deposited under stones in summer, sledges set
out to bring them to the settlements, and then they are distributed for
winter clothing. According to Hall the western tribes are in the habit
of spreading all the skins on one place and distributing them among the
inhabitants of the settlement. I&nbsp;did not observe the same custom
among the eastern tribes. Then they devote themselves to dressing the
skins. On Davis Strait this work falls to the share of the women, while
among the Hudson Bay tribes it is done by the men. At this season the
great religious feasts of the natives are celebrated, which announce, as
it were, the commencement of winter.</p>


<h4><a name = "social_laws" id = "social_laws">SOCIAL ORDER AND
LAWS.</a></h4>

<p>The social order of the Eskimo is entirely founded on the family and
on the ties of consanguinity and affinity between the individual
families. Generally children are betrothed when very young, but these
engagements, not being strictly binding, may be broken off at any time.
When the children reach maturity the girl learns the duties of a woman
and the boy those of a man. As soon as he is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page579" id =
"page579">579</a></span>
able to provide for a family and she can do the work falling to her
share, they are allowed to marry. It happens frequently that the young
man’s parents are unwilling to allow him to provide for his
parents-in-law, and then <i>he</i> may be rejected at any moment.
Usually the young couple must begin housekeeping with the young wife’s
family and the young man, if belonging to a strange tribe, must join
that of his wife. It is not until after his parents-in-law are dead that
he is entirely master of his own actions. Though the betrothal be
entered into in the days of childhood the bride must be bought from the
parents by some present. In other instances the men choose their wives
when grown up and sometimes a long wooing precedes the marriage. The
consent of the bride’s parents, or, if they are dead, that of her
brothers, is always necessary. Marriages between relatives are
forbidden: cousins, nephew and niece, aunt and uncle, are not allowed to
intermarry. There is, however, no law to prevent a man from marrying two
sisters. It is remarkable that Lyon states just the reverse
(p.&nbsp;353). I&nbsp;am sure, however, that my statements are correct
in reference to the Davis Strait tribes.</p>

<p>Should the newly married couple join the wife’s family this would
serve as a check to polygamy, which, however, is quite allowable. It is
only when the new family settles on its own account that a man is at
full liberty to take additional wives, among whom one is always
considered the chief wife. Monogamy is everywhere more frequent than
polygamy, only a very few men having two or more wives. According to
Ross polyandry occurs with the Netchillirmiut (II,&nbsp;pp.&nbsp;356,
373). As long as the mother-in-law lives with the young family the wives
are subordinate to her, while the mothers of both parties are
independent of each other. No example came to my notice of both parents
living with the newly married couple. Sometimes the man and wife do not
set up a new household at once, but each remains at home. The property
necessary for establishing a new family is the hunting gear of the man
and the knife, scraper, lamp, and cooking pot of the women.</p>

<p>A strange custom permits a man to lend his wife to a friend for a
whole season or even longer and to exchange wives as a sign of
friendship. On certain occasions it is even commanded by a religious law
(see <a href = "#page605">p.&nbsp;605</a>). Nevertheless I know of some
instances of quarrels arising from jealousy. Lyon states, however, that
this passion is unknown among the Iglulirmiut (p.&nbsp;355). The husband
is not allowed to maltreat or punish his wife; if he does she may leave
him at any time, and the wife’s mother can always command a divorce.
Both are allowed to remarry as soon as they like, even the slightest
pretext being sufficient for a separation.</p>

<p>I may be allowed to refer once more to the division of labor between
the man and woman. The principal part of the man’s work is to provide
for his family by hunting, i.e., for his wife and children and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page580" id =
"page580">580</a></span>
for his relatives who have no provider. He must drive the sledge in
traveling, feed the dogs, build the house, and make and keep in order
his hunting implements, the boat cover and seal floats excepted. The
woman has to do the household work, the sewing, and the cooking. She
must look after the lamps, make and mend the tent and boat covers,
prepare the skins, and bring up young dogs. It falls to her share to
make the inner outfit of the hut, to smooth the platforms, line the snow
house, &amp;c. On Davis Strait the men cut up all kinds of animals which
they have caught; on Hudson Bay, however, the women cut up the seals.
There the men prepare the deerskins, which is done by the women among
the eastern tribes. Everywhere the women have to do the rowing in the
large boats while the man steers. Cripples who are unable to hunt do the
same kind of work as women.</p>

<p>Children are treated very kindly and are not scolded, whipped, or
subjected to any corporal punishment. Among all the tribes infanticide
has been practiced to some extent, but probably only females or children
of widows or widowers have been murdered in this way, the latter on
account of the difficulty of providing for them. It is very remarkable
that this practice seems to be quite allowable among them, while in
Greenland it is believed that the spirit of the murdered child is turned
into an evil spirit, called angiaq, and revenges the crime (Rink,
p.&nbsp;45).</p>

<p>Besides the children properly belonging to the family, adopted
children, widows, and old people are considered part of it. Adoption is
carried on among this people to a great extent.</p>

<p>If for any reason a man is unable to provide for his family or if a
woman cannot do her household work, the children are adopted by a
relative or a friend, who considers them as his own children. In the
same way widows with their children are adopted by their nearest
relative or by a friend and belong to the family, though the woman
retains her own fireplace.</p>

<p>It is difficult to decide which relative is considered the nearest,
but the ties of consanguinity appear to be much closer than those of
affinity. If a woman dies the husband leaves his children with his
parents-in-law and returns to his own family, and if a man dies his wife
returns to her parents or her brothers, who are the nearest relatives
next to parents or children. When a woman dies, however, after the
children are grown up the widower will stay with them. In case of a
divorce the children generally remain with the mother.</p>

<p>As a great part of the personal property of a man is destroyed at his
death or placed by his grave, the objects which may be acquired by
inheritance are few. These are the gun, harpoon, sledge, dogs, kayak,
boat, and tent poles of the man and the lamp and pots of the woman. The
first inheritor of these articles is the eldest son living
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page581" id =
"page581">581</a></span>
with the parents. Sons and daughters having households of their own do
not participate in the inheritance. An elder adopted son has a
preference over a younger son born of the marriage. Details of the laws
which relate to inheritance are unknown to me.</p>

<p>Sometimes men are adopted who may almost be considered servants.
Particularly bachelors without any relations, cripples who are not able
to provide for themselves, or men who have lost their sledges and dogs
are found in this position. They fulfill minor occupations, mend the
hunting implements, fit out the sledges, feed the dogs, &amp;c.;
sometimes, however, they join the hunters. They follow the master of the
house when he removes from one place to another, make journeys in order
to do his commissions, and so on. The position, however, is a voluntary
one, and therefore these men are not less esteemed than the self
dependent providers.</p>

<p>Strangers visiting their friends for a season are generally in a
similar position, though they receive a wife if the host happens to have
more than one; if the friend has hunting gear, a&nbsp;sledge, and dogs
of his own, he can arrange a separate fireplace in the hut.</p>

<p>In summer most families have each their own tent, but in the fall
from two to four join in building a house. Frequently the parents live
on one side, the family of the son-in-law on the other, and a friend or
relative in a small recess. Sometimes two houses have a common entrance
or the passages communicate with one another. The inhabitants of both
parts usually live quite independently of one another, while the oldest
man of every house has some influence over his housemates.</p>

<p>If the distance between the winter and the summer settlement is very
great or when any particular knowledge is required to find out the
haunts of game, there is a kind of chief in the settlement, whose
acknowledged authority is, however, very limited. He is called the
pimain (i.e., he who knows everything best) or the issumautang. His
authority is virtually limited to the right of deciding on the proper
time to shift the huts from one place to the other, but the families are
not obliged to follow him. At some places it seems to be considered
proper to ask the pimain before moving to another settlement and leaving
the rest of the tribe. He may ask some men to go deer hunting, others to
go sealing, but there is not the slightest obligation to obey his
orders.</p>

<p>Every family is allowed to settle wherever it likes, visiting a
strange tribe being the only exception. In such a case the newcomer has
to undergo a ceremony which consists chiefly in a duel between a native
of the place and himself. If he is defeated he runs the risk of being
killed, by those among whom he has come (see pp. <a href =
"#page465">465</a>, <a href = "#page609">609</a>).</p>

<p>There are numerous regulations governing hunting, determining to whom
the game belongs, the obligations of the successful hunter towards the
inhabitants of the village, &amp;c.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page582" id =
"page582">582</a></span>
<p>When a seal is brought to the huts everybody is entitled to a share
of the meat and blubber, which is distributed by the hunter himself or
carried to the individual huts by his wife. This custom is only
practiced when food is scarce. In time of plenty only the housemates
receive a share of the animal.</p>

<p>A ground seal belongs to all the men who take part in the hunt, the
skin especially being divided among them. A&nbsp;walrus is cut up at
once into as many parts as there are hunters, the one who first struck
it having the choice of the parts and receiving the head. A&nbsp;whale
belongs to the whole settlement and its capture is celebrated by a feast
(<a href = "#page603">p.&nbsp;603</a>).</p>

<p>A bear or a young seal belongs to the man who first saw it, no matter
who kills it.</p>

<p>Lost objects must be restored to the owner if he is known, game,
however, excepted; for example, if a harpoon line breaks and the animal
escapes, but is found later by another man, the game belongs to the
latter. In Hudson Bay he is also allowed to keep the harpoon and
line.</p>

<p>There is no way of enforcing these unwritten laws and no punishment
for transgressors except the blood vengeance. It is not a rare
occurrence that a man who is offended by another man takes revenge by
killing the offender. It is then the right and the duty of the nearest
relative of the victim to kill the murderer. In certain quarrels between
the Netchillirmiut and the Aivillirmiut, in which the murderer himself
could not be apprehended, the family of the murdered man has killed one
of the murderer’s relations in his stead. Such a feud sometimes lasts
for a long time and is even handed down to a succeeding generation. It
is sometimes settled by mutual agreement. As a sign of reconciliation
both parties touch each other’s breasts, saying, Ilaga (my&nbsp;friend)
(Klutschak, p.&nbsp;70).</p>

<p>If a man has committed a murder or made himself odious by other
outrages he may be killed by any one simply as a matter of justice. The
man who intends to take revenge on him must ask his countrymen singly if
each agrees in the opinion that the offender is a bad man deserving
death. If all answer in the affirmative he may kill the man thus
condemned and no one is allowed to revenge the murder. (See Appendix,
<a href = "#app4">Note&nbsp;4</a>.)</p>

<p>Their method of carrying on such a feud is quite foreign to our
feelings. Strange as it may seem, a&nbsp;murderer will come to visit the
relatives of his victim (though he knows that they are allowed to kill
him in revenge) and will settle with them. He is kindly welcomed and
sometimes lives quietly for weeks and months. Then he is suddenly
challenged to a wrestling match (see <a href =
"#page609">p.&nbsp;609</a>), and if defeated is killed, or if victorious
he may kill one of the opposite party, or when hunting he is suddenly
attacked by his companions and slain.</p>

<h4><a name = "social_religion" id = "social_religion">RELIGIOUS IDEAS
AND THE ANGAKUNIRN (PRIESTHOOD).</a></h4>

<p>Although the principal religious ideas of the Central Eskimo and
those of the Greenlanders are identical, their mythologies differ in
many material points. I&nbsp;will only mention here that they believe in
the Tornait of the old Greenlanders, while the Tornarsuk (i.e., the
great Tornaq of the latter) is unknown to them. Their Supreme Being is a
woman whose name is Sedna.</p>

<p>The first report on this tradition is found in Warmow’s journal of
his visit to Cumberland Sound (Missionsblatt aus der Brüdergemeinde,
1859, No.&nbsp;I, p.&nbsp;19). The editor says:</p>

<p class = "quote">
The name of the good spirit is Sanaq or Sana, and he seems to be
worshiped as the unknown deity. Nobody could give a definite answer to
Brother Warmow’s frequent questions as to what they believed he was.
They only said they invoked his help if they were in need. “Then we ask
him,” one of the men said, “and Takaq (the moon) gives us what we want,
seals and deer.” Another one said that Sanaq had lived on the earth and
afterwards ascended to the moon.</p>

<p>In Hall’s account of his explorations in Frobisher Bay it is
mentioned that the tribes of that country, the Nugumiut, believe in a
Supreme Being, and the following statement is given (Hall&nbsp;I,
p.&nbsp;524):</p>

<p class = "quote">
There is one Supreme Being, called by them Anguta, who created the
earth, sea, and heavenly bodies. There is also a secondary divinity,
a&nbsp;woman, the daughter of Anguta, who is called Sidne. She is
supposed to have created all things having life, animal and vegetable.
She is regarded also as the protecting divinity of the Inuit people. To
her their supplications are addressed; to her their offerings are made;
while most of their religious rites and superstitious observances have
reference to her.</p>

<p>It is of great importance that in the journals of Hall’s second
journey Sedna is mentioned a few times (spelled Sydney), this being the
only proof that she is known among the tribes of Hudson Bay.</p>

<p>The statements of the whalers visiting the Sikosuilarmiut and the
Akuliarmiut of Hudson Strait correspond with my own observations. Before
entering into a comparison of this tradition with similar ones belonging
to other tribes, I&nbsp;will give the particulars of the myth as I
received it from the Oqomiut and the Akudnirmiut.</p>


<h5><a name = "social_religion_sedna" id = "social_religion_sedna">SEDNA
AND THE FULMAR.</a></h5>

<p>Once upon a time there lived on a solitary shore an Inung with his
daughter Sedna. His wife had been dead for some time and the two led a
quiet life. Sedna grew up to be a handsome girl and the youths came from
all around to sue for her hand, but none of them could touch her proud
heart. Finally, at the breaking up of the ice in the spring a fulmar
flew from over the ice and wooed Sedna with enticing song. “Come to me,”
it said; “come into the land of the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page584" id =
"page584">584</a></span>
birds, where there is never hunger, where my tent is made of the most
beautiful skins. You shall rest on soft bearskins. My fellows, the
fulmars, shall bring you all your heart may desire; their feathers shall
clothe you; your lamp shall always be filled with oil, your pot with
meat.” Sedna could not long resist such wooing and they went together
over the vast sea. When at last they reached the country of the fulmar,
after a long and hard journey, Sedna discovered that her spouse had
shamefully deceived her. Her new home was not built of beautiful pelts,
but was covered with wretched fishskins, full of holes, that gave free
entrance to wind and snow. Instead of soft reindeer skins her bed was
made of hard walrus hides and she had to live on miserable fish, which
the birds brought her. Too soon she discovered that she had thrown away
her opportunities when in her foolish pride she had rejected the Inuit
youth. In her woe she sang: “Aja. O&nbsp;father, if you knew how
wretched I am you would come to me and we would hurry away in your boat
over the waters. The birds look unkindly upon me the stranger; cold
winds roar about my bed; they give me but miserable food. O&nbsp;come
and take me back home. Aja.”</p>

<p>When a year had passed and the sea was again stirred by warmer winds,
the father left his country to visit Sedna. His daughter greeted him
joyfully and besought him to take her back home. The father hearing of
the outrages wrought upon his daughter determined upon revenge. He
killed the fulmar, took Sedna into his boat, and they quickly left the
country which had brought so much sorrow to Sedna. When the other
fulmars came home and found their companion dead and his wife gone, they
all flew away in search of the fugitives. They were very sad over the
death of their poor murdered comrade and continue to mourn and cry until
this day.</p>

<p>Having flown a short distance they discerned the boat and stirred up
a heavy storm. The sea rose in immense waves that threatened the pair
with destruction. In this mortal peril the father determined to offer
Sedna to the birds and flung her overboard. She clung to the edge of the
boat with a death grip. The cruel father then took a knife and cut off
the first joints of her fingers. Falling into the sea they were
transformed into whales, the nails turning into whalebone. Sedna holding
on to the boat more tightly, the second finger joints fell under the
sharp knife and swam away as seals (<i>Pagomys fœtidus</i>); when the
father cut off the stumps of the fingers they became ground seals
(<i>Phoca barbata</i>). Meantime the storm subsided, for the fulmars
thought Sedna was drowned. The father then allowed her to come into the
boat again. But from that time she cherished a deadly hatred against him
and swore bitter revenge. After they got ashore, she called her dogs and
let them gnaw off the feet and hands of her father while he was asleep.
Upon this he cursed himself, his daughter, and the dogs which had maimed
him;
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page585" id =
"page585">585</a></span>
whereupon the earth opened and swallowed the hut, the father, the
daughter, and the dogs. They have since lived in the land of Adlivun, of
which Sedna is the mistress.</p>

<p class = "space">
This tradition is handed down in an old song. I shall give the substance
of it here, as it differs in some points from the above myth.</p>

<p>The story begins when the fulmar carries Sedna to his home and she
discovers that he has brought her to a very wretched tent. The next year
the father and a brother, whom I find mentioned nowhere else, came to
visit her and take her home. The fulmar follows their boat and causes a
heavy gale to rise which almost upsets it. The father cuts off her
fingers, which are transformed into whales, seals, and ground seals.
Besides, he pierces her eye and thus kills her. Then he takes the body
into the boat and carries it to the shore. There he lays it on the beach
and covers it with a dogskin. When the flood comes in it covers
Sedna.</p>

<p>Sedna and her father are described by the angakut (see <a href =
"#page591">p.&nbsp;591</a>), who sometimes visit her house or see them
when both dwell among the natives, as follows: She is very large and
much taller than the Inuit. In accordance with the second form of the
tradition she has only one eye and is scarcely able to move. Her father
is also a cripple and appears to the dying, whom he grasps with his
right hand, which has only three fingers.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable resemblance between this tradition and one
related by Lyon (p.&nbsp;362), who describes the religious ideas of the
Iglulirmiut, more particularly the genii of one of their angakut. He
says that the principal spirits are Aiviliajoq (Ay-willi-ay-oo) or
Nuliajoq (Noo-le-ay-oo), a&nbsp;female spirit, and her father, Napajoq
(Nap-payok) or Anautalik (An-now-ta-lig). Then he continues:</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>The former is in the first place the mother, protectress, and not
unfrequently the monopolist of sea animals, which she sometimes very
wantonly confines below, and by that means causes a general scarcity in
the upper world. When this is the case, the angakok is persuaded to pay
her a visit, and attempt the release of the animals on which his tribe
subsist. I&nbsp;know not what ceremonies he performs at the first part
of the interview; but as the spell by which the animals are held lies in
the hand of the enchantress, the conjuror makes some bold attempts to
cut it off, and, according to his success, plenty, more or less, is
obtained. If deprived of her nails, the bears obtain their freedom;
amputation of the first joint liberates the netsiq (<i>Pagomys</i>);
while that of the second loosens the ugjuq (<i>Phoca</i>). Should the
knuckles be detached whole herds of walrus rise to the surface; and
should the adventurous angakoq succeed in cutting through the lower part
of the metacarpal bones, the monstrous whales are disenthralled and
delightedly join the other creatures of the deep. &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>Her house is exceedingly fine, and very like a
Kabluna (European) looking-glass(?); and, what is still more attractive
to an Eskimo, it contains plenty of food. Immediately within the door of
the dwelling, which has a long passage of entrance, is stationed a very
large and fierce dog, which has no tail, and whose hinder quarters are
black. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>Aiviliajoq is described
as being equally wonderful in her personal appearance as in her actions.
She is very tall and has but one eye, which is the left, the place of
the other being covered by a profusion of black
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page586" id =
"page586">586</a></span>
hair. She has one pigtail only, contrary to the established fashion in
the upper Eskimo world, which is to wear one on each side of the face,
and this is of such immense magnitude, that a man can scarcely grasp it
with both hands. Its length is exactly twice that of her arm, and it
descends to her knee. The hood of her jacket is always worn up.
&nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span></p>

<p>Her father has but one arm, the hand of which is covered by a very
large mitten of bearskin. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>He is
not larger than a boy of ten years of age. He bears the character of a
good, quiet sort of person and is master of a very nice house, which,
however, is not approachable, on account of the vast herds of walrus
lying round it, which, with numerous bears, make a terrific howling.
&nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>He has nothing to eat, and does
not even require it; in which particular he differs widely from his
daughter, who has a most voracious appetite. I&nbsp;know not if he is
the father of all terrestrial animals, but he is certainly their patron,
and withholds them at times from the Eskimo.</p>
</div>

<p>The name of the father, Anautalik (An-now-ta-lig), i.e., the man with
something to cut (with a knife), is very remarkable. Besides, it is
interesting that the angakoq who visits the dwelling of Nuliajoq has to
cut off her hand in order to liberate the sea animals. In the tradition
related in the foregoing, Sedna has another name, to wit,
Uinigumisuitung, i.e., she who would not have a husband; her father,
Savirqong, i.e., the man with the knife. Often he is only called Anguta,
her father.</p>

<p>It is evident that Nuliajoq is identical with Sedna, though some
peculiarities exist in the tradition as related by Lyon which it is
rather difficult to reconcile with the myth as it is related among the
Oqomiut. It seems to me that this difficulty arises from the mixing up
of the angakoq’s visit to Sedna with the tradition itself. Indeed Lyon
only refers to the angakoq’s visit to Nuliajoq, whom he considers a
genius of a great angakoq, though he remarks in another place
(p.&nbsp;363) that she “has a boundless command over the lives and
destinies of mankind.”</p>

<p>The tale of the angakoq’s visit makes the tradition very similar to
the Greenland myth of Arnaquagsaq, i.e., the old woman. According to
Cranz (p.&nbsp;264) and to Rink (p.&nbsp;40) this spirit has her abode
in the depth of the ocean. She represents the source of nourishment,
supplying the physical wants of mankind. She sits in her dwelling in
front of a lamp, beneath which is placed a vessel which receives the oil
that keeps flowing down from the lamp. From this vessel, as well as from
the dark interior of her hut, she sends out all the animals which serve
for food, but in certain cases withholds the supply, thus causing want
and famine. The reason for thus withholding the supply was that certain
filthy and noxious parasites fastened themselves upon her head, of which
she could only be relieved by an angakoq. Then she could be induced
again to send out the animals for the benefit of man. In going to her he
(the angakoq) had first to pass the Arsissut and then to cross an abyss,
in which, according to the earliest authors, a&nbsp;wheel as slippery as
ice was constantly
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page587" id =
"page587">587</a></span>
turning around; then, having safely passed a boiling kettle with seals
in it, he arrived at the house, in front of which watch was kept by
terrible animals, sometimes described as seals, sometimes as dogs; and,
lastly, within the house passage itself, he had to cross an abyss by
means of a bridge as narrow as a knife edge.</p>

<p>About the same tale is found among the Baffin Land tribes; according
to Captain Spicer, of Groton, Conn., she is called Nanoquagsaq by the
Akuliarmiut. She is visited by the angakut, who liberate the sea animals
by subduing her or rather by depriving her of a charm by which she
restrains the animals.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the form in which Lyon gives this
tradition is not quite correct, but is a mixture of the Sedna myth and
that of the angakoq’s visit to Arnaquagsaq. This seems the more probable
from a Greenland tale which Dr. Rink kindly communicated to me, in which
it is related that the grandfather of Arnaquagsaq cut off her fingers,
which were changed into sea animals.</p>

<p>For this reason it is most probable that Arnaquagsaq, Sedna, and
Nuliajoq proceed from the same myth, though the traditions differ from
one another as they are related by the travelers. In the mythology of
the central tribes this character has a much more decided influence upon
their religious belief than the Arnaquagsaq of the Greenlanders seems to
have had.</p>

<p>The myth of Sedna is confused with another which treats of the origin
of the Europeans and of the Adlet (see <a href =
"#page637">p.&nbsp;637</a>). The legends are in part almost identical.
Sedna orders her dog to gnaw off her father’s feet; Uinigumisuitung’s
children maim their grandfather in the same way; and, besides, Sedna’s
second name is also Uinigumisuitung. In both tales the father is called
Savirqong. In Lyon’s Private Journal (p.&nbsp;363) an important
statement is found to the effect that the dog which protects Nuliajoq’s
dwelling is by some natives called her husband, by others merely her
dog, but that he is generally considered the father of Erqigdlit
(identical with Adlet, p.&nbsp;637) and Qadlunait (Europeans).</p>

<p>Finally, I must record the legend of the origin of the walrus and the
reindeer, which is closely related to the Sedna tradition. I&nbsp;could
never learn any other reason why the use of sea animals and reindeer at
the same period should be forbidden, except the fear of offending Sedna.
She is represented as disliking the deer, which accordingly are not
found in her house. Any reason for this dislike is not given. The
Akuliarmiut, however, have a tradition that a woman, most probably Sedna
herself, created the walrus and the reindeer during a famine. She opened
her belly and took out a small piece of fat which she carried up the
hills where it was transformed by a magic spell into a reindeer. As soon
as she saw the animal she became frightened and ordered it to run away,
but the deer turned upon her and would not go; then she became angry and
knocked out its teeth.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page588" id =
"page588">588</a></span>
It turned round at once, but before it could leave she gave it a kick
which lopped off its tail. Thus it happened that the deer is deficient
as to certain teeth and has scarcely any tail. The woman, however,
continued to hate the deer. Afterward she descended to the beach and
threw another piece of fat into the water. It was transformed into a
walrus, which swam away at once. (According to a communication of
Captain Spicer.)</p>

<p>The form of this tradition as related by the Akudnirmiut is somewhat
different. During a famine a woman (I&nbsp;could not learn whether she
was identical with Sedna or not) carried her boots to the hills and
transformed them by magic into deer, which spread all over the country.
Then she carried her breeches to the sea, where they were changed into
walrus. The first deer, however, had large tusks and no horns, while the
walrus had horns and no tusks. The Eskimo soon found that this was very
dangerous for the hunter, as the deer killed pursuers with their tusks,
while the walrus upset the boats. Therefore an old man transferred the
horns to the deer and the tusks to the walrus.</p>

<p>It is very probable that this woman was Sedna, as the Eskimo affirm
that the observances referring to walrus and deer are commanded by Sedna
and as the first tradition accounts for her dislike of the deer.</p>

<p>I could not find any trace of the tradition reported by Lyon, that
Anautalik, Nuliajoq’s father, is the protector of land animals, nor of
that of a being to whom he refers by the name of Pukimna (derived from
pukiq, the white parts of a deerskin), who lives in a fine country far
to the west and who is the immediate protectress of deer, which animals
roam in immense herds around her dwelling.</p>

<p>Sedna is the mistress of one of the countries to which the souls go
after death. It has been related in the foregoing tradition of Sedna and
the fulmar that she descended to Adlivun; since that time she has been
the mistress of the country, and when invoked as such has the name of
Idliragijenget. She has a large house, in which no deerskins are found.
There she lives with her father, each occupying one side of it. The
father, who is unable to move, lies on the ledge and is covered with old
skins. In the entrance across the threshold lies Sedna’s dog watching
her house. Like her, the father has only one eye, and he never moves
from his place while in the house.</p>

<p>The dead, who are seized by Sedna’s father, Anguta, are carried to
this dwelling. The dog moves aside only a little, just enough to allow
the souls to pass. They have to stay in this dismal abode during a whole
year, lying by the side of Anguta, who pinches them.</p>

<p>The happy land is heaven and is called Qudlivun (the uppermost ones).
It abounds with deer, which are easily caught, and no ice or snow ever
visits it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page589" id =
"page589">589</a></span>
<p>The Oqomiut and the Akudnirmiut make a distinction between Adlivun
and Adliparmiut. Adlivun means “those who live beneath us;” Adliparmiut,
“the inhabitants of the country farthest below us;” and the same
difference exists between Qudlivun and Qudliparmiut. Though these names
intimate the probability that the Eskimo believe in a series of places,
located in a descending scale, each below the other, I&nbsp;could not
find any more detailed description of the conception.</p>

<p>Hall’s observations agree fairly with my own. He says (I,
p.&nbsp;524):</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>Qudliparmiut (heaven) is upward. Everybody happy there. All the time
light; no snow, no ice, no storms; always pleasant; no trouble; never
tired; sing and play all the time&mdash;all this to continue without
end.</p>

<p>Adliparmiut (hell) is downward. Always dark there. No sun; trouble
there continually; snow flying all the time, terrible storms; cold, very
cold; and a great deal of ice there. All who go there must always
remain.</p>

<p>All Inuit who have been good go to Qudliparmiut; that is, who have
been kind to the poor and hungry, all who have been happy while living
on this earth. Any one who has been killed by accident, or who has
committed suicide, certainly goes to the happy place.</p>

<p>All Inuit who have been bad&mdash;that is, unkind one to
another&mdash;all who have been unhappy while on this earth, will go to
Adliparmiut. If an Inung kills another because he is mad at him, he will
certainly go to Adliparmiut.</p>
</div>

<p>Kumlien’s remarks on this subject, as well as on other ethnographic
subjects, are not trustworthy. He has transferred Greenland tales to
Cumberland Sound, though the traditions of these tribes differ
materially one from the other. I&nbsp;tried hard to corroborate his
statements concerning the amaroq and the tornarsuq, concerning certain
customs, &amp;c., and am convinced that they are totally unknown to all
the natives of Baffin Land from Nugumiut to Tununirn.</p>

<p>Kumlien states that the better land is below the surface of the earth
and that those who are killed by violence descend after death. According
to Hall and to replies to my own inquiries, it is quite the reverse.
Lyon’s report is extremely interesting, particularly his description of
the stages of the nether world, of which I could only find a scanty hint
in the names. He says (p.&nbsp;372):</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>There are two places appointed to receive the souls of the good: one
of these is in the center of the earth, the other in qilaq, or heaven.
To the latter place, such as are drowned at sea, starved to death,
murdered, or killed by walruses or bears, are instantly wafted, and
dwell in a charming country, which, however, has never been seen by any
angakoq. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span></p>

<p>The place of souls in the world below is called Adli generally; but
there are, properly, four distinct states of blessedness, and each rank
has a world to itself, the lowest land being the last and best, which
all hope to reach. The day on which a good person dies and is buried,
the soul goes to a land immediately under the visible world; and, still
descending, it arrives the second day at one yet lower; the third day it
goes farther yet; and on the fourth it finds, “below the lowest deep,
a&nbsp;deeper still.” This is the “good land,” and the soul which
reaches it is for ever happy. The three first stages are bad
uncomfortable places for in each the sky is so close to the earth, that
a man cannot walk erect: yet these regions are inhabited; and the good
soul, in passing through them, sees multitudes of the dead, who, having
lost
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page590" id =
"page590">590</a></span>
their way, or, not being entitled to the “good land,” are always
wandering about and in great distress. Whether these unhappy souls are
in purgatory or not, I&nbsp;was unable to learn; but they suffer no
other pain than what we would call the “fidgets.” In the lowest Adli a
perpetual and delightful summer prevails.</p>
</div>

<p>The belief of these tribes undoubtedly is that all who die by
accident or by violence and women who die in childbirth are taken to the
upper world. I&nbsp;never heard a different opinion expressed by any
native. I&nbsp;do not know whether they believe in a series of upper
worlds similar to the nether worlds of the Iglulirmiut, but it is
probable, from the names Qudlivun and Qudliparmiut. In the Greenland
tradition the upper world is represented as a country with hills and
valleys, over which the solid blue sky is expanded. Sedna of the Oqomiut
lives in Adlivun, and here the souls must stay one year after death.
Everybody who dies from disease or who has offended Sedna by infringing
her orders is taken to her. The Eskimo are in great fear of the terrors
of her abode. Murderers and offenders against human laws, after they
have entered Sedna’s house, will never leave it; the other souls,
however, are taken to the Adliparmiut, where they live comparatively at
their ease, although they are not nearly so blessed as the Qudliparmiut.
They hunt whales and walrus and are almost always troubled by ice and
snow.</p>

<p>The older authors on Greenland mythology state that the conceptions
of the natives do not coincide (Cranz). According to one tradition the
good land is below, and tornarsuq, the supreme tornaq, is master of it.
Here continuous summer prevails and there is plenty of fresh water, with
a profusion of game. Only those people are allowed to come here who have
been good hunters and workers, who have accomplished great exploits,
caught many seals, who have suffered much, or have died by violence or
in childbirth. The souls of the deceased must slide for five days, or
even longer, down a steep rock, which has become quite slippery from the
blood which has been sprinkled over it. Those who have been lazy and
unfit for working go to the upper world, where they suffer from scarcity
of food. Particularly the bad and witches are taken to this country,
where they are tormented by ravens.</p>

<p>Another tradition places the good land in heaven. The souls travel on
the rainbow to the moon, near which they find a large lake abounding
with fowls and fish. Rink gives the following statement on this subject
(p.&nbsp;37):</p>

<p class = "quote">
After death, human souls either go to the upper or to the under world.
The latter is decidedly to be preferred, as being warm and rich in food.
There are the dwellings of the happy dead called arsissut,&mdash;viz,
those who live in abundance. On the contrary, those who go to the upper
world will suffer from cold and famine; and these are called the
arssartut, or ball players, on account of their playing at ball with a
walrus head, which gives rise to the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>While the Iglulirmiut believe that the soul leaves the body
immediately after death and descends to Adli, the tribes of Davis Strait
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page591" id =
"page591">591</a></span>
suppose that it lingers three days around the body, unable to leave it.
Then it descends to Sedna’s house. During its stay in Adlivun the soul
is called tupilaq, which is represented by the figure of a man with
wide, loose, shabby clothing. It is looked upon as a malevolent spirit,
frequently roaming around the villages. The tupilaq is not allowed to
enter the houses, and if the angakoq perceives and announces his
presence no one would dare to leave the houses. His touch kills men at
once, the sight of him causes sickness and mischief. As soon as the soul
has become an adliparmio, it is at rest and ceases to be feared as a
tupilaq.</p>

<p>It is worth remarking that the Greenlanders designate with the name
of tupilaq a supernatural being made by men for the purpose of
destroying their enemies (Rink, p.&nbsp;53). It is composed of various
parts of different animals and is enabled to act in the shape of any of
them at will. I&nbsp;have not found any trace of this idea among the
Central Eskimo.</p>


<h5><a name = "social_religion_tornait" id =
"social_religion_tornait">THE TORNAIT AND THE ANGAKUT.</a></h5>

<p>A consideration of the religious ideas of the Eskimo shows that the
tornait, the invisible rulers of every object, are the most remarkable
beings next to Sedna. Everything has its inua (owner), which may become
the genius of man who thus obtains the qualities of angakunirn.
I&nbsp;am not quite sure that every inua can become the tornaq of a man,
though with the Greenlanders this was possible. I&nbsp;learned of three
kinds of spirits only, who are protectors of angakut: those in the shape
of men, of stones, and of bears. These spirits enable the angakut to
have intercourse with the others who are considered malevolent to
mankind, and though those three species are kind to their angakut they
would hurt strangers who might happen to see them. The bear seems to be
the most powerful among these spirits. The tornait of the stones live in
the large bowlders scattered over the country. The Eskimo believe that
these rocks are hollow and form a nice house, the entrance of which is
only visible to the angakoq whose genius lives in the stone. The tornaq
is a woman with only one eye, in the middle of the brow. Another kind of
tornaq lives in the stones that roll down the hills in spring when the
snow begins to melt. If a native happens to meet such a stone, which is
about to become his tornaq, the latter addresses him: “I&nbsp;jumped
down in long leaps from my place on the cliff. As the snow melts, as
water is formed on the hills, I&nbsp;jump down.” Then it asks the native
whether he is willing to have it for his tornaq, and if he answers in
the affirmative it accompanies him, wabbling along, as it has no
legs.</p>

<p>The bear tornaq is represented as a huge animal without any hair
except on the points of the ears and of the tail and at the mouth. If a
man wishes to obtain a bear for his tornaq he must travel all alone
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page592" id =
"page592">592</a></span>
to the edge of the land floe and summon the bears. Then a large herd
will approach and frighten him almost to death. He falls down at once.
Should he fall backward he would die at once. If he falls upon his face,
however, one bear out of the herd steps forward and asks him if he
wishes him to become his tornaq. He then recovers and takes the bear for
his spirit and is accompanied by him on the return journey. On the way
home, they pass a seal hole and the bear captures the animal for his
master. The Eskimo is now a great angakoq, and whenever he wants help he
is sure to get it from his bear.</p>

<p>The Eskimo do not make images of the tornait or other supernatural
beings in whom they believe, but use to a great extent amulets (<ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘armgoaq’">arngoaq</ins>), some
of which are given by the tornait, while others are inherited. The most
common varieties of amulets are the feather of an owl, a&nbsp;bear’s
tooth, and the like, which are always worn on the middle of the back of
the inner jacket. Rare minerals (e.g., iron) sewed up in a piece of skin
are sometimes used for the same purpose. A&nbsp;small part of the first
gown worn by a child is considered a powerful amulet and is preserved
for this reason. It is worn at the point of the hood at a great feast
celebrated every fall (see pp. <a href = "#page604">604</a>, <a href =
"#page611">611</a>) and is called koukparmiutang.</p>

<p>Lyon (p. 367) gives the following account of the use of amulets in
Iglulik:</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>Bones and teeth of animals, hanging as solitary pendants, or strung
in great numbers, have peculiar virtues, and the bones of the feet of
the kabliaqdjuq, which I imagine to be the wolverine, are the most in
request. The front teeth of musk oxen are considered as jewels, while
the grinders, one or two together, are much esteemed as tassels for the
strings used to tie up the breeches of the women. Eye teeth of foxes are
sometimes seen to the number of hundreds, neatly perforated and arranged
as a kind of fringe round caps or dresses, and even the bones and teeth
of fish have their value.</p>

<p>Leather cases of the size of a quill, and containing small pieces of
deer’s or other flesh, are frequently attached to the caps or hoods of
children, but whether to render them expert hunters, or to preserve
their health, I&nbsp;could not discover. I&nbsp;was assured that broken
spear heads, and other equally cumbrous pendants, worn round the necks
of young girls, were spells for the preservation of their chastity,
while the same ornaments caused the women to be prolific.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal office of the angakut is to find out the reason of
sickness and death or of any other misfortune visiting the natives.</p>

<p>The Eskimo believes that he is obliged to answer the angakoq’s
questions truthfully. The lamps being lowered, the angakoq strips off
his outer jacket, pulls the hood over his head, and sits down in the
back part of the hut facing the wall. He claps his hands, which are
covered with mittens, and, shaking his whole body, utters sounds which
one would hardly recognize as human.</p>

<p>Thus he invokes his tornaq, singing and shouting alternately, the
listeners, who sit on the edge of the bed, joining the chorus and
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page593" id =
"page593">593</a></span>
answering his questions. Then he asks the sick person: “Did you work
when it was forbidden?” “Did you eat when you were not allowed to eat?”
And if the poor fellow happens to remember any transgression of such
laws, he cries: “Yes, I&nbsp;have worked.” “Yes, I&nbsp;have eaten.” And
the angakoq rejoins “I&nbsp;thought so” and issues his commands as to
the manner of atonement.</p>

<p>These are manifold. Exchange of wives between two men or adoption of
a sick child by another family in order to save its life are frequently
demanded. The inhabitants of a village are forbidden to wash themselves
for a number of days, to scrape the ice from the windows, and to clean
their urine pots before sunrise. Sometimes the angakoq commands that the
clothing be thrown away or gives regulations for diet, particularly
forbidding the eating of venison, working on deerskins, filing iron,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Disorders of women are considered as a punishment for the neglect to
observe the regulations referring to their behavior at certain periods,
which regulations were established by Sedna. The same is stated by Lyon
(p.&nbsp;363).</p>

<p>A method of finding out the reason of a disease is by “head lifting.”
A&nbsp;thong is tied round the head of the sick person or of a relative,
who must lie down on the bed, the angakoq holding the thong. Then he
asks his tornaq the reason of the sickness and the remedy. If the tornaq
answers a question of the angakoq in the affirmative the head is easily
lifted. In the other case it feels so heavy that he is unable to move
it. Another method is by lifting a boot or a stone, which has been
placed under the pillow of the patient. The angakut believe that the
boot or stone becomes heavy and cannot be lifted when the tornaq answers
their incantations.</p>

<p>At the beginning of some of their performances I have observed the
angakoq crawling about in the passage of the hut, howling and shouting,
while those inside kept on singing. Then he entered the hut and
continued the incantations on the back part of the bed.</p>

<p>Sometimes their cure for sickness is laying a piece of burning wick
upon the diseased part of the body and blowing it up into the air or
merely blowing upon it.</p>

<p>Storm and bad weather, when lasting a long time and causing want of
food, are conjured by making a large whip of seaweed, stepping to the
beach, and striking out in the direction whence the wind blows, at the
same time crying Taba (It&nbsp;is enough).</p>

<p>A great number of the performances of the angakut require much skill
and expertness. Thus in invoking a tornaq or flying to a distant place
they can imitate a distant voice by a sort of ventriloquism. In these
performances they always have the lamps extinguished and hide themselves
behind a screen hung up in the back part of the hut. The tornaq, being
invoked, is heard approaching and shaking the hut. The angakoq believes
that it is unroofed and flies with
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page594" id =
"page594">594</a></span>
his spirit to their place of destination, to propitiate the wrath of a
hostile tornaq, to visit the moon or Sedna’s dismal abode.</p>

<p>Part of their performances might almost be called juggling. Hall
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;101) describes one of these performances:</p>

<p class = "quote">
The angakoq (Ar-too-a) now made use of three walrus spears. One of these
he thrust into the wall of the snow house, and &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>ran with it outside of the igdlu [house] where his
ejaculations were responded to by the party inside with the cries of
“Atte! Atte!” [Go on! Go on!]. Returning with his spear to the door, he
had a severe wrestling match with four of the men, who overcame him. But
coming again into the central igdlu, and having the lights which had
been at the first patted down, relit, he showed the points of two spears
apparently covered with fresh blood, which he held up in the presence of
all.</p>

<p>The performance of the angakut in the Sedna feast, which will be
described hereafter (<a href = "#page604">p.&nbsp;604</a>) is quite
astonishing. Some pierce their bodies with harpoons, evidently having
bladders filled with blood fastened under their jackets beforehand, and
bleed profusely as they enter the hut. (See Appendix, <a href =
"#app5">Note&nbsp;5</a>.)</p>

<p>A memorable ceremony has been described by Hall (I, p. 469):</p>

<p class = "quote">
I heard a loud shout just outside [the hut]. As quick as thought, the
Eskimo sprang for the long knives lying around, and hid them wherever
they could find places. &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>Immediately there came crawling into the low
entrance to the hut a man with long hair completely covering his face
and eyes. He remained on his knees on the floor of the hut, feeling
round like a blind man at each side of the entrance, back of the
firelight, the place where meat is usually kept, and where knives may
generally be found. Not finding any, the angakoq slowly withdrew.
&nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>If he had found a knife he would
have stabbed himself in the breast.</p>

<p>It is one of their favorite tricks to have their hands tied up and a
thong fastened around their knees and neck. Then they begin invoking
their tornaq, and all of a sudden the body lies motionless while the
soul flies to any place which they wish to visit. After returning, the
thongs are found untied, though they had been fastened by firm knots.
The resemblance of this performance to the experiments of modern
spiritualists is striking.</p>

<p>The angakut use a sacred language in their songs and incantations.
A&nbsp;great number of words have a symbolic meaning, but others are old
roots, which have been lost from common use in the lapse of time. These
archaic words are very interesting from a linguistic point of view.
Indeed, some are found which are still in use in Greenland, though lost
in the other dialects, and others which are only used in Alaska.</p>

<p>I ought to add here that most of the angakut themselves believe in
their performances, as by continued shouting and invoking they fall into
an ecstasy and really imagine they accomplish the flights and see the
spirits.</p>

<p>The angakoq, who must be paid at once for curing a sick person,
receives pretty large fees for services of this kind.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page595" id =
"page595">595</a></span>
<p>Although witchcraft occupied a prominent place in the belief of the
Greenlanders I could only find very faint traces of it in Baffin Land,
to wit, the opinion that a man has the power of injuring a distant enemy
by some means the details of which I did not learn.</p>

<p>I shall add here the numerous regulations referring to eating and
working, many of which are connected with the Sedna tradition, and the
observance of which is watched by the angakut. As all sea animals have
originated from her fingers the Eskimo must make an atonement for every
animal he kills. When a seal is brought into the hut the women must stop
working until it is cut up. After the capture of a ground seal, walrus,
or whale they must rest for three days. Not all kinds of work, however,
are forbidden, for they are allowed to mend articles made of sealskin,
but they must not make anything new. For instance, an old tent cover may
be enlarged in order to build a larger hut, but it is not permitted to
make a new one. Working on new deerskins is strictly forbidden. No skins
of this kind obtained in summer may be prepared before the ice has
formed and the first seal is caught with the harpoon. Later, as soon as
the first walrus is caught, the work must stop again until the next
fall. For this reason all families are eager to finish the work on
deerskins as quickly as possible, as the walrusing season is not
commenced until that is done.</p>

<p>The laws prohibiting contact with deer and sea animals at the same
time are very strict. According to the Eskimo themselves Sedna dislikes
the deer (probably for some reason connected with the tradition of its
origin,) and therefore they are not allowed to bring it in contact with
her favorites. The meat of the whale, seal, or walrus must not be eaten
on the same day with venison. It is not permitted that both sorts of
meat lie on the floor of the hut or behind the lamps at the same time.
If a man who has eaten venison in the morning happens to enter a hut in
which seal meat is being cooked he is allowed to eat venison on the bed,
but it must be wrapped up before being carried into the hut and he must
take care to keep clear of the floor. Before changing from one food to
the other the Eskimo must wash themselves. For the same reason walrus
hide must not be carried to Lake Nettilling, which is considered the
domain of deer.</p>

<p>A similar custom requires that the Ukusiksalirmiut carry salmon into
a hut by a separate entrance, for it must not pass through the same one
as seal oil. Besides, the fish must only be cooked at the distance of a
day’s journey from the place where they have been caught. If eaten on
the spot they must be eaten raw (Klutschak, p.&nbsp;158).</p>

<p>Their customs referring to hunting are manifold. When skinning a deer
they must not break a single bone; then, they cut off bits of different
parts of the animal and bury them in the ground or under stones (Hall I,
p.&nbsp;386). I&nbsp;have never noticed this custom myself.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page596" id =
"page596">596</a></span>
On the west shore of Hudson Bay dogs are not allowed to gnaw deer bones
during the deer hunting season or seal bones during the sealing season
(Klutschak, p.&nbsp;123). Deer bones must not be broken while walrus are
hunted (Hall II, p.&nbsp;155).</p>

<p>When the men go out hunting in their kayaks the women of the
Aivillirmiut take a cup down to the shore and leave it there, believing
that it will bring luck (Hall II, p.&nbsp;103). On Davis Strait they
throw a piece of seal’s blubber on their husband’s kayak when he is
about to go hunting (Kumlien, p.&nbsp;45). After the capture of a whale
the Aivillirmiut are not allowed to burn shrubs, but use bones of the
whale instead, which are mixed with blubber (Hall II, p.&nbsp;364). If
an animal that is with young is killed the fetus must not be taken and
used for food (Hall II, p.&nbsp;253). When a bear is caught the Nugumiut
and the Oqomiut are accustomed to fasten its bladder to a stick which is
placed upright near the hut or encampment for three days.</p>

<p>When a house is deserted the Aivillirmiut are in the habit of
carrying all the bones lying inside to some distance and putting them
upon the ice (Hall II, p.&nbsp;175). If they intend to move to a place
some distance away they are in the habit of burying some of their
clothing. Klutschak observed this custom among the Netchillirmiut;
I&nbsp;myself, among the Akudnirmiut. If a great number of families
leave a village those who remain build new houses, as they believe that
they would otherwise have bad luck in hunting.</p>

<p>A great number of regulations refer to the behavior of women during
menstruation. They are not allowed to eat raw meat, they must cook in
separate pots, and are not permitted to join in festivals, being looked
upon as unclean during this period. Customs referring to childbirth and
sickness will be found further on (see <a href =
"#page609">p.&nbsp;609</a>).</p>

<p>When a traveling party visits a neighboring tribe it is obliged to
adopt the customs and regulations of the latter.</p>

<p>This account does not by any means include all the peculiar customs
of these people, for they are so numerous and the difficulty of finding
out anything pertaining to this subject is so great that it is probable
that the greater part of them have escaped notice.</p>

<p>I shall also mention a few customs that are peculiar to certain
places. At Qeqertelung, east of Naujateling, in Cumberland Sound, the
Eskimo dig potstone, but must buy it from the rock: that is, having dug
out a piece, they must give the rock something in exchange; for example,
ivory carvings, beads, food, or the like.</p>

<p>At Arligaulik, near Wager River, the Eskimo address a large rock and
bid it farewell when passing (Hall II, p.&nbsp;174).</p>

<p>In Cumberland Sound there is a cape called Iliqimisarbing, i.e., the
place of headshaking. The place is very dangerous, as heavy squalls
sweep down the steep rocks and slides frequently occur. Therefore the
natives never pass it without shaking their heads, at the same time
uttering a deep murmur.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page597" id =
"page597">597</a></span>
<p>Besides the tornait already mentioned, a number of others are known
which cannot become genii of men. A&nbsp;spirit of the sea, Kalopaling
or Mitiling, is described in a tradition (see <a href =
"#page620">p.&nbsp;620</a>). In Erdmann’s Wörterbuch des
Labradordialectes “Mitiling” is translated Gespenst, i.e., ghost. No
doubt it is the name of the same spirit or at least of a similar one
which is recognized among the northern tribes, the literal translation
being “with eider ducks.” Another spirit of which the natives are in
great fear is Qiqirn, a&nbsp;phantom in the shape of a huge dog almost
without hair. Like the bear which has been alluded to, it has hair only
at the mouth, the feet, and the points of the ears and the tail. If it
comes near dogs or men they fall into fits and only recover when Qiqirn
has left. It is exceedingly afraid of men and runs away as soon as an
angakoq descries it.</p>

<p>A very remarkable tornaq is the qaggim inua, i.e., master of the
dancing house. The natives build large houses for feasting, singing, and
dancing, which are devoted to spirits. This tornaq has the shape of a
bandy legged man, his knees being bent outward and forward. He has not a
single hair upon his entire body and no bones at the back of his head.
To touch him would result in immediate death (see <a href =
"#page636">p.&nbsp;636</a>).</p>

<p>Besides these tornait, more powerful supernatural beings are known,
who are “owners” (inua) of the stars and constellations and of
meteorologic processes. Moon and sun are considered brother and sister,
and in this the tradition of the Central Eskimo exactly corresponds with
that of the Greenlanders. It is even known among the Eskimo of Point
Barrow (Simpson, p.&nbsp;940). From Repulse Bay (Aivillirmiut)
a&nbsp;few scanty traces of this tradition are recorded by Rae
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;79). He relates as follows:</p>

<p class = "quote">
It is said that many years ago, not long after the creation of the
world, there was a mighty conjurer, who gained so much power that at
last he raised himself up into the heavens, taking with him his sister
(a&nbsp;beautiful girl) and a fire. To the latter he added great
quantities of fuel, which thus formed the sun. For some time he and his
sister lived in great harmony, but at last they disagreed, and he, in
addition to maltreating the lady in many ways, at last scorched the side
of her face. She had suffered patiently all sorts of indignities, but
the spoiling of her beauty was not to be borne; she therefore ran away
from him and formed the moon, and continues so until this day. Her
brother is still in chase of her, but although he gets near, he will
never overtake her. When it is new moon, the burnt side of the face is
towards us; when full moon, the reverse is the case.</p>

<p>The following form of the legend, which I received from some
Akudnirmiut and Oqomiut, is almost identical with the Greenland one:</p>

<p>In olden times a brother and his sister lived in a large village in
which there was a singing house, and every night the sister with her
playfellows enjoyed themselves in this house. Once upon a time, when all
the lamps in the singing house were extinguished, somebody came in and
outraged her. She was unable to recognize him; but
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page598" id =
"page598">598</a></span>
she blackened her hands with soot and when the same again happened
besmeared the man’s back with it. When the lamps were relighted she saw
that the violator was her brother. In great anger she sharpened a knife
and cut off her breasts, which she offered to him, saying: “Since you
seem to relish me, eat this.” Her brother fell into a passion and she
fled from him, running about the room. She seized a piece of wood (with
which the lamps are kept in order) which was burning brightly and rushed
out of the house. The brother took another one, but in his pursuit he
fell down and extinguished his light, which continued to glow only
faintly. Gradually both were lifted up and continued their course in the
sky, the sister being transformed into the sun, the brother into the
moon. Whenever the new moon first appears she sings:</p>

<p>My brother up there, he is coming up there.)</p>
</div>


<h5><a name = "social_religion_moon" id = "social_religion_moon">THE
FLIGHT TO THE MOON.</a></h5>

<p>There exists another tradition in regard to the spirit of the moon,
which is also known to the Greenlanders. While in the first tradition
the moon is a man carrying a glowing light, in the other she is the moon
man’s house (Rink, p.&nbsp;440). The legend, as told by the Oqomiut and
Akudnirmiut, is the narrative of the flight of an angakoq to the moon
and is as follows:</p>

<p>A mighty angakoq, who had a bear for his tornaq, resolved to pay a
visit to the moon. He sat down in the rear of his hut, turning his back
toward the lamps, which had been extinguished. He had his hands tied up
and a thong fastened around his knees and neck. Then he summoned his
tornaq, which carried him rapidly through the air and brought him to the
moon. He observed that the moon was a house, nicely covered with white
deerskins, which the man in the moon used to dry near it. On each side
of the entrance was the upper portion of the body of an enormous walrus,
which threatened to tear in pieces the bold intruder. Though it was
dangerous to pass by the fierce animals, the angakoq, by help of his
tornaq, succeeded in entering the house.</p>

<p>In the passage he saw the only dog of the man of the moon, which is
called Tirie´tiang and is dappled white and red. On entering the main
room he perceived, to the left, a&nbsp;small additional building, in
which a beautiful woman, the sun, sat before her lamp. As soon as she
saw the angakoq entering she blew her fire, behind the blaze of which
she hid herself. The man in the moon came to meet him kindly, stepping
from the seat on the ledge and bidding the stranger welcome. Behind the
lamps great heaps of venison and seal meat were piled up, but the man of
the moon did not yet offer him anything.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page599" id =
"page599">599</a></span>
He said: “My wife, Ululiernang, will soon enter and we will perform a
dance. Mind that you do not laugh, else she will slit open your belly
with her knife, take out your intestines, and give them to my ermine
which lives in yon little house outside.”</p>

<p>Before long a woman entered carrying an oblong vessel in which her
ulo (see <a href = "#page518">p.&nbsp;518</a>) lay. She put it on the
floor and stooped forward, turning the vessel like a whirligig. Then she
commenced dancing, and when she turned her back toward the angakoq it
was made manifest that she was hollow. She had no back, backbone, or
entrails, but only lungs and heart.</p>

<p>The man joined her dance and their attitudes and grimaces looked so
funny that the angakoq could scarcely keep from laughing. But just at
the right moment he called to mind the warnings of the man in the moon
and rushed out of the house. The man cried after him,
“Uqsureliktaleqdjuin” (“Provide yourself with your large white bear
tornaq”).<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href =
"#note7">7</a> Thus he escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>Upon another visit he succeeded in mastering his inclination to laugh
and was hospitably received by the man after the performance was
finished. He showed him all around the house and let him look into a
small additional building near the entrance. There he saw large herds of
deer apparently roaming over vast plains, and the man of the moon
allowed him to choose one animal, which fell immediately through a hole
upon the earth. In another building he saw a profusion of seals swimming
in an ocean and was allowed to pick out one of these also. At last the
man in the moon sent him away, when his tornaq carried him back to his
hut as quickly as he had left it.</p>

<p>During his visit to the moon his body had lain motionless and
soulless, but now it revived. The thongs with which his hands had been
fastened had fallen down, though they had been tied in firm knots. The
angakoq felt almost exhausted, and when the lamps were relighted he
related to the eagerly listening men his adventures during his flight to
the moon.</p>

<p>It is related in the course of this tradition that the man in the
moon has a qaumat, some kind of light or fire, but I could not reach a
satisfactory understanding of the meaning of this word. It is derived
from qauq (daylight) and is used in Greenland for the moon herself.
Among the Eskimo of Baffin Land it is only employed in the angakoq
language, in which the moon is called qaumavun, the sun qaumativun.
Another name of the moon is aninga (her brother), in reference to the
first legend. The natives also believe that the man in the moon makes
the snow. He is generally considered a protector of orphans and of the
poor, and sometimes descends from his house on a sledge drawn by his
dog, Tirie´tiang, in order to help them (see the tradition of
Qaudjaqdjuq, <a href = "#page630">p.&nbsp;630</a>).</p>

<h5><a name = "social_religion_kadlu" id = "social_religion_kadlu">KADLU
THE THUNDERER.</a></h5>

<p>It is said that three sisters make the lightning, the thunder, and
the rain. The names of two of them are Ingnirtung (the one who strikes
the fire) and Udluqtung (the one who rubs the skins), whose second name
is Kadlu (thunder), while that of the third I could not ascertain. They
live in a large house the walls of which are supported by whale ribs. It
stands in the far west, at a great distance from the sea, as Kadlu and
her sisters do not like to go near it. If an Eskimo should happen to
enter the house he must hasten away or Ingnirtung will immediately kill
him with her lightning. Even the stones are afraid of her and jump down
the hills whenever they see the lightning and hear the thunder. The
faces of the sisters are entirely black and they wear no clothes at
all.(?) Ingnirtung makes the lightning by striking two red stones
together (flint). Kadlu makes the thunder by rubbing sealskins and
singing. The third sister makes the rain by urinating. They procure food
by striking reindeer with the lightning, which singes their skins and
roasts their flesh. The Akudnirmiut say that beyond Iglulik, on the
continent of America, a&nbsp;large tribe of Eskimo live whom they call
Kakī´joq. The women of the tribe are said to have rings tattooed round
their eyes. These natives offer the dried skins of a species of small
seals to Kadlu, who uses them for making the thunder.</p>


<h4><a name = "social_feasts" id = "social_feasts">FEASTS, RELIGIOUS AND
SECULAR.</a></h4>

<p>The Eskimo have some very interesting feasts, most of which are
closely connected with their religious notions. In summer feasts are
celebrated in the open air, but in winter a house, called qaggi, or, as
we may call it, singing house, is built for that purpose.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 531.</span> Diagram showing interior of
qaggi or singing house among eastern tribes.</p>

<p>The plan of the house which is used by the eastern tribes is
represented in Fig. 531. It is a large snow dome about fifteen feet in
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page601" id =
"page601">601</a></span>
height and twenty feet in diameter, without any lining. In the center
there is a snow pillar five feet high, on which the lamps stand. When
the inhabitants of a village assemble in this building for singing and
dancing the married women stand in a row next the wall. The unmarried
women form a circle inside the former, while the men sit in the
innermost row. The children stand in two groups, one at each side of the
door. When the feast begins, a&nbsp;man takes up the drum (kilaut),
which will be described presently, steps into the open space next the
door, and begins singing and dancing. Among the stone foundations of
Niutang, in Kingnait (Cumberland Sound), there is a qaggi built on the
same plan as the snow structure. Probably it was covered with a snow
roof when in use.</p>

<p>Hall gives the plan of the Hudson Bay qaggi (Fig. 532), a copy of
which is here introduced, as well as his description of the drum (Fig.
533), which I have never seen made (Hall II, p.&nbsp;96):</p>

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 533.</span> Kilaut or drum.</p>
</div>

<div class = "quote">
<p>The drum is made from the skin of the deer [or seal], which is
stretched over a hoop made of wood, or of bone from the fin of a whale,
by the use of a strong, braided cord of sinew passed around a groove on
the outside. The hoop is about 2½ inches wide, 1½ inches thick, and 3
feet in diameter, the whole instrument weighing about 4 pounds. The
wooden drumstick, 10 inches in length and 3 inches in diameter, is
called a kentun. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span></p>

<p>The deerskin which is to be the head of the instrument is kept frozen
when not in use. It is then thoroughly saturated with water, drawn over
the hoop, and temporarily fastened in its place by a piece of sinew.
A&nbsp;line of heavy, twisted sinew, about 50 feet long, is now wound
tightly on the groove on the outside of the hoop, binding down the skin.
This cord is fastened to the handle of the kilaut [drum], which is made
to turn by the force of several men (while its other end is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page602" id =
"page602">602</a></span>
held firmly), and the line eased out as required. To do this a man sits
on the bed-<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘platorm’">platform</ins>, “having one or two turns of the line about
his body, which is encased in furred deerskins, and empaled by four
upright pieces of wood.” Tension is secured by using a round stick of
wood as a lever on the edge of the skin, drawing it from beneath the
cord. When any whirring sound is heard, little whisps of reindeer hair
are tucked in between the skin and the hoop, until the head is as tight
as a drum.</p>

<p>performer, who strikes the edge of the rim opposite that over which
the skin is stretched. He holds the drum in different positions, but
keeps it in a constant fan-like motion by his hand and by the blows of
the kentun struck alternately on the opposite sides of the edge.
Skillfully keeping the drum vibrating on the handle, he accompanies this
with grotesque motions of the body, and at intervals with a song, while
the women keep up their own Inuit songs, one after another, through the
whole performance.</p>
</div>

<p>The feast is described as follows:</p>

<p class = "quote">
As usual the women sat on the platform Turk fashion; the men, behind
them with extended legs. The women were gayly dressed. They wore on each
side of the face an enormous pigtail, made by wrapping their hair on a
small wooden roller a foot in length; strips of reindeer-fur being
wrapped with the hair [see <a href = "#page559">p.&nbsp;559</a>]. These
were black and white for those who had sons and black only for those who
had none. Shining ornaments were worn on the head and on the breast they
had masonic-like aprons, the groundwork of which was of a flaming red
color, ornamented with glass beads of many colors.</p>

<p>In Cumberland Sound the women also wear pigtails at the celebration
of these feasts. The drum is sometimes played with the wrist of the
right hand instead of the beater.</p>

<p>Every singing house is dedicated to a tornaq, the qaggim inua, as
mentioned above. For this reason all these performances may be
considered religious feasts.</p>

<p>The songs are always composed by the singer himself. Satiric songs
are great favorites on these occasions. While the men listen in silence
the women join in the chorus, amna aya, the never failing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page603" id =
"page603">603</a></span>
end of each verse. The dancer remains on one spot only, stamping <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘rythmically’">rhythmically</ins> with the feet, swinging the upper part
of his body, and at the same time playing the kilaut. While dancing he
always strips the upper part of the body, keeping on only trousers and
boots. Singing and dancing are alternated with wrestling matches and
playing at hook and crook. Almost every great success in hunting is
celebrated in the qaggi, and especially the capture of a whale. Such a
feast has been described by Parry.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 534.</span> Plans of remains of supposed
qaggin or singing houses. (From Parry II, p.&nbsp;362.)</p>

<p>The stone foundations observed by Parry and copied here (Fig. 534)
are probably the remains of singing houses. Parry’s description is as
follows (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;362):</p>

<p class = "quote">
It appears that the whole whale or a principal part of it is dragged
into the enclosure, where some of the men are employed in cutting it up
and throwing the pieces over the wall to the rest, who stand ready to
receive them outside; while within the women range themselves in a
circle around the whale and continue singing during the operation.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Each of these structures *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was the
distinct property of a particular individual; and had probably, in its
turn, been the seat of feasting and merriment either to the present
owner, or those from whom he had inherited it.</p>

<p>Great feasts closely connected with the Sedna tradition are
celebrated every fall.</p>

<p>When late in the fall storms rage over the land and release the sea
from the icy fetters by which it is as yet but slightly bound, when the
loosened floes are driven one against the other and break up with loud
crashes, when the cakes of ice are piled in wild disorder one upon
another, the Eskimo believes he hears the voices of spirits which
inhabit the mischief laden air.</p>

<p>The spirits of the dead, the tupilaq, knock wildly at the huts, which
they cannot enter, and woe to the unhappy person whom they can lay hold
of. He immediately sickens and a speedy death is regarded as sure to
come. The wicked qiqirn pursues the dogs, which die with convulsions and
cramps as soon as they see him. All the countless spirits of evil are
aroused, striving to bring sickness and death, bad weather, and failure
in hunting. The worst visitors are Sedna, mistress of the under world,
and her father, to whose share the dead
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page604" id =
"page604">604</a></span>
Inuit fall. While the other spirits fill the air and the water, she
rises from under the ground.</p>

<p>It is then a busy season for the wizards. In every hut we may hear
them singing and praying; conjuring of the spirits is going on in every
house. The lamps burn low. The wizard sits in a mystic gloom in the rear
of the hut. He has thrown off his outer coat and drawn the hood of his
inner garment over his head, while he mutters indescribable sounds,
unnatural to a human voice. At last the guardian spirit responds to the
invocation. The angakoq lies in a trance and when he comes to himself he
promises in incoherent phrases the help of the good spirit against the
tupilaq and informs the credulous, affrighted Inuit how they can escape
from the dreaded ghosts.</p>

<p>The hardest task, that of driving away Sedna, is reserved for the
most powerful angakoq. A&nbsp;rope is coiled on the floor of a large hut
in such a manner as to leave a small opening at the top, which
represents the breathing hole of a seal. Two angakut stand by the side
of it, one of them holding the seal spear in his left hand, as if he
were watching at the seal hole in the winter, the other holding the
harpoon line. Another angakoq, whose office it is to lure Sedna up with
a magic song, sits at the back of the hut. At last she comes up through
the hard rocks and the wizard hears her heavy breathing; now she emerges
from the ground and meets the angakoq waiting at the hole. She is
harpooned and sinks away in angry haste, drawing after her the harpoon,
to which the two men hold with all their strength. Only by a desperate
effort does she tear herself away from it and return to her dwelling in
Adlivun. Nothing is left with the two men but the blood sprinkled
harpoon, which they proudly show to the Inuit.</p>

<p>Sedna and the other evil spirits are at last driven away, and on the
following day a great festival for young and old is celebrated in honor
of the event. But they must still be careful, for the wounded Sedna is
greatly enraged and will seize any one whom she can find out of his hut;
so on this day they all wear protecting amulets (koukparmiutang) on the
tops of their hoods. Parts of the first garment which they wore after
birth are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The men assemble early in the morning in the middle of the
settlement. As soon as they have all got together they run screaming and
jumping around the houses, following the course of the sun
(nunajisartung or kaivitijung). A&nbsp;few, dressed in women’s jackets,
run in the opposite direction. These are those who were born in abnormal
presentations. The circuit made, they visit every hut, and the woman of
the house must always be in waiting for them. When she hears the noise
of the band she comes out and throws a dish containing little gifts of
meat, ivory trinkets, and articles of sealskin into the yelling crowd,
of which each one helps himself to what he can get. No hut is omitted in
this round (irqatatung).</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page605" id =
"page605">605</a></span>
<p>The crowd next divides itself into two parties, the ptarmigans
(aχigirn), those who were born in the winter, and the ducks (aggirn), or
the children of summer. A&nbsp;large rope of sealskin is stretched out.
One party takes one end of it and tries with all its might to drag the
opposite party over to its side. The others hold fast to the rope and
try as hard to make ground for themselves. If the ptarmigans give way
the summer has won the game and fine weather may be expected to prevail
through the winter (nussueraqtung).</p>

<p>The contest of the seasons having been decided, the women bring out
of a hut a large kettle of water and each person takes his drinking cup.
They all stand as near the kettle as possible, while the oldest man
among them steps out first. He dips a cup of water from the vessel,
sprinkles a few drops on the ground, turns his face toward the home of
his youth, and tells his name and the place of his birth
(oχsoaχsavepunga&mdash;&mdash;me, I&nbsp;was born in &mdash;&mdash;). He
is followed by an aged woman, who announces her name and home, and then
all the others do the same, down to the young children, who are
represented by their mothers. Only the parents of children born during
the last year are forbidden to partake in this ceremony. As the words of
the old are listened to respectfully, so those of the distinguished
hunters are received with demonstrative applause and those of the others
with varying degrees of attention, in some cases even with joking and
raillery (imitijung).</p>

<p>Now arises a cry of surprise and all eyes are turned toward a hut out
of which stalk two gigantic figures. They wear heavy boots; their legs
are swelled out to a wonderful thickness with several pairs of breeches;
the shoulders of each are covered by a woman’s over-jacket and the faces
by tattooed masks of sealskins. In the right hand each carries the seal
spear, on the back of each is an inflated buoy of sealskin, and in the
left hand the scraper. Silently, with long strides, the qailertetang
(Fig. 535) approach the assembly, who, screaming, press back from them.
The pair solemnly lead the men to a suitable spot and set them in a row,
and the women in another opposite them. They match the men and women in
pairs and these pairs run, pursued by the qailertetang, to the hut of
the woman, where they are for the following day and night man and wife
(nulianititijung). Having performed this duty, the qailertetang stride
down to the shore and invoke the good north wind, which brings fair
weather, while they warn off the unfavorable south wind.</p>

<p>As soon as the incantation is over, all the men attack the
qailertetang with great noise. They act as if they had weapons in their
hands and would kill both spirits. One pretends to probe them with a
spear, another to stab them with a knife, one to cut off their arms and
legs, another to beat them unmercifully on the head. The buoys which
they carry on their backs are ripped open and collapse and soon they
both lie as if dead beside their broken weapons (pilektung).
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page606" id =
"page606">606</a></span>
The Eskimo leave them to get their drinking cups and the qailertetang
awake to new life. Each man fills his sealskin with water, passes a cup
to them, and inquires about the future, about the fortunes of the hunt
and the events of life. The qailertetang answer in murmurs which the
questioner must interpret for himself.</p>

<p>The evening is spent in playing ball, which is whipped all around the
settlement (ajuktaqtung). (See Appendix, <a href =
"#app6">Note&nbsp;6</a>.)</p>

<p>This feast is celebrated as here described in Cumberland Sound and
Nugumiut. Hall and Kumlien make a few observations in regard to it, but
the latter has evidently misunderstood its meaning. His description is
as follows (p.&nbsp;43):</p>

<p class = "quote">
An angakoq dresses himself up in the most hideous manner, having several
pairs of pants on among the rest, and a horrid looking mask of skins.
The men and women now range themselves in separate and opposite ranks,
and the angakoq takes
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page607" id =
"page607">607</a></span>
his place between them. He then picks out a man and conducts him to a
woman in the opposite ranks. This couple then go to the woman’s hut and
have a grand spree for a day or two. This manner of proceeding is kept
up till all the women but one are disposed of. This one is always the
angakoq’s choice, and her he reserves for himself.</p>

<p>Another description by Kumlien (p. 19) evidently refers to the same
feast:</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>They have an interesting custom or superstition, namely, the killing
of the evil spirit of the deer; sometime during the winter or early in
spring, at any rate before they can go deer hunting, they congregate
together and dispose of this imaginary evil. The chief ancut [angakoq],
or medicine man, is the main performer. He goes through a number of
gyrations and contortions, constantly hallooing and calling, till
suddenly the imaginary deer is among them. Now begins a lively time.
Every one is screaming, <ins class = "correction" title = "‘i’ invisible">running</ins>, jumping, spearing, and stabbing at the
imaginary deer, till one would think a whole madhouse was let loose.
Often this deer proves very agile, and must be hard to kill, for I have
known them to keep this performance up for days; in fact, till they were
completely exhausted.</p>

<p>During one of these performances an old man speared the deer, another
knocked out an eye, a&nbsp;third stabbed him, and so on till he was
dead. Those who are able or fortunate enough to inflict some injury on
this bad deer, especially he who inflicts the death blow, is considered
extremely lucky, as he will have no difficulty in procuring as many deer
as he wants, for there is no longer an evil spirit to turn his bullets
or arrows from their course.</p>
</div>

<p>I could not learn anything about this ceremony, though I asked all
the persons with whom Kumlien had had intercourse. Probably there was
some misunderstanding as to the meaning of their feast during the autumn
which induced him to give this report.</p>

<p>Hall describes the feast as celebrated by the Nugumiut (I,
p.&nbsp;528), as follows:</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>At a time of the year apparently answering to our Christmas, they
have a general meeting in a large igdlu [snow house] on a certain
evening. There the angakoq prays on behalf of the people for the public
prosperity through the subsequent year. Then follows something like a
feast. The next day all go out into the open air and form in a circle;
in the centre is placed a vessel of water, and each member of the
company brings a piece of meat, the kind being immaterial. The circle
being formed, each person eats his or her meat in silence, thinking of
Sedna, and wishing for good things. Then one in the circle takes a cup,
dips up some of the water, all the time thinking of Sedna, and drinks
it; and then, before passing the cup to another, states audibly the time
and the place of his or her birth. This ceremony is performed by all in
succession. Finally, presents of various articles are thrown from one to
another, with the idea that each will receive of Sedna good things in
proportion to the liberality here shown.</p>

<p>Soon after this occasion, at a time which answers to our New Year’s
day, two men start out, one of them being dressed to represent a woman,
and go to every house in the village, blowing out the light in each. The
lights are afterwards rekindled from a fresh fire. When Taqulitu [Hall’s
well known companion in his journeys] was asked the meaning of this, she
replied, “New sun&mdash;new light,” implying a belief that the sun was
at that time renewed for the year.</p>
</div>

<p>Inasmuch as Hall did not see the feast himself, but had only a
description by an Eskimo, into which he introduced points of similarity
with Christian feasts, it may be looked upon as fairly agreeing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page608" id =
"page608">608</a></span>
with the feast of the Oqomiut. The latter part corresponds to the
celebration of the feast as it is celebrated in Akudnirn.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a></p>

<p>According to a statement in the journal of Hall’s second expedition
(II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;219) masks are also used on the western shore of
Hudson Bay, where it seems that all the natives disguise themselves on
this occasion.</p>

<p>The Akudnirmiut celebrate the feast in the following way: The
qailertetang do not act a part there, but other masks take their place.
They are called mirqussang and represent a man and his wife. They wear
masks of the skin of the ground seal, only that of the woman being
tattooed. The hair of the man is arranged in a bunch protruding from the
forehead (sulubaut), that of the woman in a pigtail on each side and a
large knot at the back of the head. Their left legs are tied up by a
thong running around the neck and the knee, compelling them to hobble.
They have neither seal float and spear nor inflated legs, but carry the
skin scraper. They must try to enter the huts while the Inuit hold a
long sealskin thong before them to keep them off. If they fall down in
the attempt to cross it they are thoroughly beaten with a short whip or
with sticks. After having succeeded in entering the huts they blow out
all the fires.</p>

<p>The parts of the feast already described as celebrated in Cumberland
Sound seem not to be customary in Akudnirn, the conjuration of Sedna and
the exchanges of wives excepted, which are also practiced here.
Sometimes the latter ceremony takes place the night before the feast. It
is called suluiting or quvietung.</p>

<p>When it is quite dark a number of Inuit come out of their huts and
run crying all round their settlements. Wherever anybody is asleep they
climb upon the roof of his hut and rouse him by screaming and shouting
until all have assembled outside. Then a woman and a man (the
mirqussang) sit down in the snow. The man holds a knife (sulung) in his
hand, from which the feast takes its name, and sings:</p>

<div class = "song">
<p>Oangaja jaja jajaja aja.</p>
<p>Pissiungmipadlo panginejernago</p>
<p>Qodlungutaokpan panginejerlugping</p>
<p>Pissiungmipadlo panginejernago.</p>
</div>

<p>To this song the woman keeps time by moving her body and her arms, at
the same time flinging snow on the bystanders. Then the whole company
goes into the singing house and joins in dancing and singing. This done,
the men must leave the house and stand outside while the mirqussang
watch the entrance. The women continue singing and leave the house one
by one. They are awaited by the mirqussang, who lead every one to one of
the men standing about. The pair must re-enter the singing house and
walk around the lamp,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page609" id =
"page609">609</a></span>
all the men and women crying, “Hrr! hrr!” from both corners of the
mouth. Then they go to the woman’s hut, where they stay during the
ensuing night. The feast is frequently celebrated by all the tribes of
Davis and Hudson Strait, and even independently of the great feast
described above.</p>

<p>The day after, the men frequently join in a shooting match.
A&nbsp;target is set up, at which they shoot their arrows. As soon as a
man hits, the women, who stand looking on, rush forward and rub noses
with him.</p>

<p>If a stranger unknown to the inhabitants of a settlement arrives on a
visit he is welcomed by the celebration of a great feast. Among the
southeastern tribes the natives arrange themselves in a row, one man
standing in front of it. The stranger approaches slowly, his arms folded
and his head inclined toward the right side. Then the native strikes him
with all his strength on the right cheek and in his turn inclines his
head awaiting the stranger’s blow (tigluiqdjung). While this is going on
the other men are playing at ball and singing (igdlukitaqtung). Thus
they continue until one of the combatants is vanquished.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of greeting among the western tribes are similar to
those of the eastern, but in addition “boxing, wrestling, and knife
testing” are mentioned by travelers who have visited them. In Davis
Strait and probably in all the other countries the game of “hook and
crook” is always played on the arrival of a stranger (pakijumijartung).
Two men sit down on a large skin, after having stripped the upper part
of their bodies, and each tries to stretch out the bent arm of the
other. These games are sometimes dangerous, as the victor has the right
to kill his adversary; but generally the feast ends peaceably. The
ceremonies of the western tribes in greeting a stranger are much feared
by their eastern neighbors and therefore intercourse is somewhat
restricted. The meaning of the duel, according to the natives
themselves, is “that the two men in meeting wish to know which of them
is the better man.” The similarity of these ceremonies with those of
Greenland, where the game of hook and crook and wrestling matches have
been customary, is quite striking, as is that of the explanation of
these ceremonies.</p>

<p>The word for greeting on Davis Strait and Hudson Strait, is
Assojutidlin? (Are you quite well?) and the answer, Tabaujuradlu (Very
well). The word Taima! which is used in Hudson Strait, and Mane taima!
of the Netchillirmiut seem to be similar to our Halloo! The
Ukusiksalirmiut say Ilaga! (My&nbsp;friend!)</p>


<h4><a name = "social_birth" id = "social_birth">CUSTOMS AND REGULATIONS
CONCERNING BIRTH, SICKNESS, AND DEATH.</a></h4>

<p>I have mentioned that it is extremely difficult to find out the
innumerable regulations connected with the religious ideas and customs
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page610" id =
"page610">610</a></span>
of the Eskimo. The difficulty is even greater in regard to the customs
which refer to birth, sickness, and death, and it is no wonder that,
while some of the accounts of different writers coincide tolerably well,
there are great discrepancies in others, particularly as the customs
vary to a great extent among the different tribes.</p>

<p>Before the child is born a small hut or snow house is built for the
mother, in which she awaits her delivery. Sick persons are isolated in
the same way, the reason being that in case of death everything that had
been in contact with the deceased must be destroyed. According to
Kumlien (p.&nbsp;28) the woman is left with only one attendant,
a&nbsp;young girl appointed by the head ancut (angakoq) of the
encampment; but this, no doubt, is an error. She may be visited by her
friends, who, however, must leave her when parturition takes place. She
must cut the navel string herself, and in Davis Strait this is done by
tying it through with deer sinews; in Iglulik (Lyon, p.&nbsp;370), by
cutting it with a stone spear head. The child is cleaned with a birdskin
and clothed in a small gown of the same material. According to Lyon the
Iglulirmiut swathe it with the dried intestines of some animal.</p>

<p>Kumlien describes a remarkable custom of which I could find no trace,
not even upon direct inquiry (p.&nbsp;281):</p>

<p class = "quote">
As soon as the mother with her new born babe is able to get up and go
out, usually but a few hours, they are taken in charge by an aged female
angakoq, who seems to have some particular mission to perform in such
cases. She conducts them to some level spot on the ice, if near the sea,
and begins a sort of march in circles on the ice, the mother following
with the child on her back; this manœuvre is kept up for some time, the
old woman going through a number of performances the nature of which we
could not learn and continually muttering something equally
unintelligible to us. The next act is to wade through snowdrifts, the
aged angakoq leading the way. We have been informed that it is customary
for the mother to wade thus bare-legged.</p>

<p>Lyon says (p. 370):</p>

<p class = "quote">
After a few days, or according to the fancy of the parents, an angakoq,
who by relationship or long acquaintance is a friend of the family,
makes use of some vessel, and with the urine the mother washes the
infant, while all the gossips around pour forth their good wishes for
the little one to prove an active man, if a boy, or, if a girl, the
mother of plenty of children. This ceremony, I&nbsp;believe, is never
omitted, and is called qoqsiuariva.</p>

<p>Though I heard about the washing with urine, I did not learn anything
about the rest of the ceremony in Cumberland Sound and Davis Strait.</p>

<p>A few days after birth the first dress of the child is exchanged for
another. A&nbsp;small hood made from the skin of a hare’s head is fitted
snugly upon the head, a&nbsp;jacket for the upper part of the body is
made of the skin of a fawn, and two small boots, made of the same kind
of a skin, the left one being wreathed with seaweed (<i>Fucus</i>),
cover the legs. While the child wears this clothing that which was first
worn is fastened to a pole which is secured to the roof of the hut. In
two
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page611" id =
"page611">611</a></span>
months the child gets a third suit of clothes the same as formerly
described (<a href = "#page557">p.&nbsp;557</a>). Then the second gown
is exposed for some time on the top of the hut, the first one being
taken down, and both are carefully preserved for a year. After this time
has expired both are once more exposed on the top of a pole and then
sunk into the sea, a&nbsp;portion of the birdskin dress alone being
kept, for this is considered a powerful amulet and is held in high
esteem and worn every fall at the Sedna feast on the point of the hood
(see <a href = "#page604">p.&nbsp;604</a>). I&nbsp;have stated that
those who were born in abnormal presentations wear women’s dresses at
this feast and must make their round in a direction opposite to the
movement of the sun. Captain Spicer, of Groton, Conn., affirms that the
bird used for the first clothing is chosen according to a strict law,
every month having its own bird. So far as I know, waterfowl are used in
summer and the ptarmigan in winter, and accordingly the men are called
at the great autumn feast the ducks and ptarmigans, the former including
those who were born in summer, the latter those born in winter.</p>

<p>As long as any portion of the navel string remains a strip of
sealskin is worn around the belly.</p>

<p>After the birth of her child the mother must observe a great number
of regulations, referring particularly to food and work. She is not
allowed for a whole year to eat raw meat or a part of any animal killed
by being shot through the heart. In Cumberland Sound she must not eat
for five days anything except meat of an animal killed by her husband or
by a boy on his first hunting expedition. This custom seems to be
observed more strictly, however, and for a longer period if the new born
child dies. Two months after delivery she must make a call at every hut,
while before that time she is not allowed to enter any but her own. At
the end of this period she must also throw away her old clothing. The
same custom was observed by Hall among the Nugumiut
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;426). On the western shore of Hudson Bay she is
permitted to re-enter the hut a few days after delivery, but must pass
in by a separate entrance. An opening is cut for the purpose through the
snow wall. She must keep a little skin bag hung up near her, into which
she must put a little of her food after each meal, having first put it
up to her mouth. This is called laying up food for the infant, although
none is given to it (Hall II, p.&nbsp;173). I&nbsp;have already
mentioned that the parents are not allowed in the first year after the
birth of a child to take part in the Sedna feast.</p>

<p>The customs which are associated with the death of an infant are very
complicated. For a whole year, when outside the hut, the mother must
have her head covered with a cap, or at least with a piece of skin. If a
ground seal is caught she must throw away the old cap and have a new one
made. The boots of the deceased are always carried about by the parents
when traveling, and whenever they stop
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page612" id =
"page612">612</a></span>
these are buried in the snow or under stones. Neither parent is allowed
to eat raw flesh during the following year. The woman must cook her food
in a small pot which is exclusively used by her. If she is about to
enter a hut the men who may be sitting inside must come out first, and
not until they have come out is she allowed to enter. If she wants to go
out of the hut she must walk around all the men who may happen to be
there.</p>

<p>The child is sometimes named before it is born. Lyon says upon this
subject (p.&nbsp;369):</p>

<p class = "quote">
Some relative or friend lays her hand on the mother’s stomach, and
decides what the infant is to be called, and, as the names serve for
either sex, it is of no consequence whether it proves a girl or a
boy.</p>

<p>On Davis Strait it is always named after the persons who have died
since the last birth took place, and therefore the number of names of an
Eskimo is sometimes rather large. If a relative dies while the child is
younger than four years or so, his name is added to the old ones and
becomes the proper name by which it is called. It is possible that
children receive the names of all the persons in the settlement who die
while the children are quite young, but of this I am not absolutely
certain. When a person falls sick the angakut change his name in order
to ward off the disease or they consecrate him as a dog to Sedna. In the
latter event he gets a dog’s name and must wear throughout life a
harness over the inner jacket. Thus it may happen that Eskimo are known
in different tribes by different names. It may also be mentioned here
that friends sometimes exchange names and dogs are called by the name of
a friend as a token of regard.</p>

<p>The treatment of the sick is the task of the angakoq, whose
manipulations have been described.</p>

<p>If it is feared that a disease will prove fatal, a small snow house
or a hut is built, according to the season, into which the patient is
carried through an opening at the back. This opening is then closed, and
subsequently a door is cut out. A&nbsp;small quantity of food is placed
in the hut, but the patient is left without attendants. As long as there
is no fear of sudden death the relatives and friends may come to visit
him, but when death is impending the house is shut up and he is left
alone to die. If it should happen that a person dies in a hut among its
inmates, everything belonging to the hut must be destroyed or thrown
away, even the tools &amp;c. lying inside becoming useless to the
survivors, but the tent poles may be used again after a year has
elapsed. No doubt this custom explains the isolation of the sick. If a
child dies in a hut and the mother immediately rushes out with it, the
contents of the hut may be saved.</p>

<p>Though the Eskimo feel the greatest awe in touching a dead body, the
sick await their death with admirable coolness and without the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page613" id =
"page613">613</a></span>
least sign of fear or unwillingness to die. I&nbsp;remember a young girl
who sent for me a few hours before her death and asked me to give her
some tobacco and bread, which she wanted to take to her mother, who had
died a few weeks before.</p>

<p>Only the relatives are allowed to touch the body of the deceased.
They clothe it or wrap it in deerskins and bury it at once. In former
times they always built a tomb, at least when death occurred in the
summer. From its usual dimensions one would suppose that the body was
buried with the legs doubled up, for all of them are too short for grown
persons. If the person to be buried is young, his feet are placed in the
direction of the rising sun, those of the aged in the opposite
direction. According to Lyon the Iglulirmiut bury half grown children
with the feet towards the southeast, young men and women with the feet
towards the south, and middle aged persons with the feet towards the
southwest. This agrees with the fact that the graves in Cumberland Sound
do not all lie east and west. The tomb is always vaulted, as any stone
or piece of snow resting upon the body is believed to be a burden to the
soul of the deceased. The man’s hunting implements and other utensils
are placed by the side of his grave; the pots, the lamps, knives,
&amp;c., by the side of that of the woman; toys, by that of a child.
Hall (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;103) observed in a grave a small kettle hung up
over a lamp. These objects are held in great respect and are never
removed, at least as long as it is known to whose grave they belong.
Sometimes models of implements are used for this purpose instead of the
objects themselves. Figure 536 represents a model of a lamp found in a
grave of Cumberland Sound. Nowadays the Eskimo place the body in a box,
if they can procure one, or cover it very slightly with stones or snow.
It is strange that, though the ceremonies of burying are very strictly
attended to and though they take care to give the dead their belongings,
they do not heed the opening of the graves by dogs or wolves and the
devouring of the bodies and do not attempt to recover them when the
graves are invaded by animals.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p class = "caption">
<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 536.</span> Model of lamp from a grave in
Cumberland Sound. (Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin.)</p>

<p>The body must be carried to the place of burial by the nearest
relatives, a&nbsp;few others only accompanying it. For this purpose they
rarely avail themselves of a sledge, as it cannot be used afterward, but
must be left with the deceased. Dogs are never allowed to drag the
sledge on such an occasion. After returning from the burial the
relatives must lock themselves up in the old hut for three days, during
which they mourn the loss of the deceased. During this time
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page614" id =
"page614">614</a></span>
they do not dress their hair and they have their nostrils closed with a
piece of deerskin. After this they leave the hut forever. The dogs are
thrown into it through the window and allowed to devour whatever they
can get at. For some time afterward the mourners must cook their meals
in a separate pot. A&nbsp;strange custom was observed by Hall in Hudson
Bay (II,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;186). The mourners did not smoke. They kept their
hoods on from morning till night. To the hood the skin and feathers of
the head of <i>Uria grylle</i> were fastened and a feather of the same
waterfowl to each arm just above the elbow. All male relatives of the
deceased wore a belt around the waist, besides which they constantly
wore mittens. It is probable that at the present time all Eskimo when in
mourning avoid using implements of European manufacture and suspend the
use of tobacco. It has already been stated that women who have lost a
child must keep their heads covered.</p>

<p>Parry, Lyon (p. 369), and Klutschak (p. 201) state that when the
Eskimo first hear of the death of a relative they throw themselves upon
the ground and cry, not for grief, but as a mourning ceremony.</p>

<p>For three or sometimes even four days after a death the inhabitants
of a village must not use their dogs, but must walk to the hunting
ground, and for one day at least they are not allowed to go hunting at
all. The women must stop all kinds of work.</p>

<p>On the third day after death the relatives visit the tomb and travel
around it three times in the same direction as the sun is moving, at the
same time talking to the deceased and promising that they will bring him
something to eat. According to Lyon the Iglulirmiut chant forth
inquiries as to the welfare of the departed soul, whether it has reached
the land Adli, if it has plenty of food, &amp;c., at each question
stopping at the head of the grave and repeating some ceremonial words
(p.&nbsp;371).</p>

<p>These visits to the grave are repeated a year after death and
whenever they pass it in traveling. Sometimes they carry food to the
deceased, which he is expected to return greatly increased. Hall
describes this custom as practiced by the Nugumiut
(I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;426). He says:</p>

<p class = "quote">
They took down small pieces of [deer] skin with the fur on, and of
[fat]. When there they stood around [the] grave [of the woman] upon
which they placed the articles they had brought. Then one of them
stepped up, took a piece of the [deer meat], cut a slice and ate it, at
the same time cutting off another slice and placing it under a stone by
the grave. Then the knife was passed from one hand to the other, both
hands being thrown behind the person. This form of shifting the
implement was continued for perhaps a minute, the motions being
accompanied by constant talk with the dead. Then a piece of [deer] fur
and some [fat] were placed under the stone with an exclamation
signifying, “Here is something to eat and something to keep you warm.”
Each of the [natives] also went through the same forms. They never visit
the grave of a departed friend until some months after
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page615" id =
"page615">615</a></span>
death, and even then only when all the surviving members of the family
have removed to another place. Whenever they return to the vicinity of
their kindred’s grave, a&nbsp;visit is made to it with the best of food
as a present for the departed one. Neither seal, polar bear, nor walrus,
however, is taken.</p>

<p>According to Klutschak (p. 154), the natives of Hudson Bay avoid
staying a long time on the salt water ice near the grave of a
relative.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after death the relatives may go for the first time
upon the ice, but the men are not allowed to hunt; on the next day they
must go sealing, but without dogs and sledge, walking to the hunting
ground and dragging the seal home. On the sixth day they are at liberty
to use their dogs again. For a whole year they must not join in any
festival and are not allowed to sing certain songs.</p>

<p>If a married woman dies the widower is not permitted to keep any part
of the first seal he catches after her death except the flesh. Skin,
blubber, bones, and entrails must be sunk in the sea.</p>

<p>All the relatives must have new suits of clothes made and before the
others are cast away they are not allowed to enter a hut without having
asked and obtained permission. (See Appendix, <a href =
"#app7">Note&nbsp;7</a>.)</p>

<p>Lyon (p. 368) makes the following statement on the mourning
ceremonies in Iglulik:</p>

<p class = "quote">
Widows are forbidden for six months to taste of unboiled flesh; they
wear no &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>pigtails, and cut off a
portion of their long hair in token of grief, while the remaining locks
hang in loose disorder about their shoulders. &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>After six months, the disconsolate ladies are at
liberty to eat raw meat, to dress their pigtails and to marry as fast as
they please; while in the meantime they either cohabit with their future
husbands, if they have one, or distribute their favors more generally.
A&nbsp;widower and his children remain during three days within the hut
where his wife died, after which it is customary to remove to another.
He is not allowed to fish or hunt for a whole season, or in that period
to marry again. During the three days of lamentation all the relatives
of the deceased are quite careless of their dress; their hair hangs
wildly about, and, if possible, they are more than usually dirty in
their persons. All visitors to a mourning family consider it as
indispensably necessary to howl at their first entry.</p>

<p>I may add here that suicide is not of rare occurrence, as according
to the religious ideas of the Eskimo the souls of those who die by
violence go to Qudlivun, the happy land. For the same reason it is
considered lawful for a man to kill his aged parents. In suicide death
is generally brought about by hanging.</p>




<h3><a name = "tales" id = "tales">TALES AND TRADITIONS.</a></h3>


<h4><a name = "tales_ititaujang" id =
"tales_ititaujang">ITITAUJANG.</a></h4>

<p>A long, long time ago, a young man, whose name was Ititaujang, lived
in a village with many of his friends. When he became grown he wished to
take a wife and went to a hut in which he knew an orphan girl was
living. However, as he was bashful and was afraid to speak to the young
girl himself, he called her little
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page616" id =
"page616">616</a></span>
brother, who was playing before the hut, and said, “Go to your sister
and ask her if she will marry me.” The boy ran to his sister and
delivered the message. The young girl sent him back and bade him ask the
name of her suitor. When she heard that his name was Ititaujang she told
him to go away and look for another wife, as she was not willing to
marry a man with such an ugly name.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id =
"tag9" href = "#note9">9</a> But Ititaujang did not submit and sent the
boy once more to his sister. “Tell her that Nettirsuaqdjung is my other
name,” said he. The boy, however, said upon entering, “Ititaujang is
standing before the doorway and wants to marry you.” Again the sister
said “I&nbsp;will not have a man with that ugly name.” When the boy
returned to Ititaujang and repeated his sister’s speech, he sent him
back once more and said, “Tell her that Nettirsuaqdjung is my other
name.” Again the boy entered and said, “Ititaujang is standing before
the doorway and wants to marry you.” The sister answered, “I&nbsp;will
not have a man with that ugly name.” When the boy returned to Ititaujang
and told him to go away, he was sent in the third time on the same
commission, but to no better effect. Again the young girl declined his
offer, and upon that Ititaujang went away in great anger. He did not
care for any other girl of his tribe, but left the country altogether
and wandered over hills and through valleys up the country many days and
many nights.</p>

<p>At last he arrived in the land of the birds and saw a lakelet in
which many geese were swimming. On the shore he saw a great number of
boots; cautiously he crept nearer and stole as many as he could get hold
of. A&nbsp;short time after the birds left the water and finding the
boots gone became greatly alarmed and flew away. Only one of the flock
remained behind, crying, “I&nbsp;want to have my boots; I&nbsp;want to
have my boots.” Ititaujang came forth now and answered, “I&nbsp;will
give you your boots if you will become my wife.” She objected, but when
Ititaujang turned round to go away with the boots she agreed, though
rather reluctantly.</p>

<p>Having put on the boots she was transformed into a woman and they
wandered down to the seaside, where they settled in a large village.
Here they lived together for some years and had a son. In time
Ititaujang became a highly respected man, as he was by far the best
whaler among the Inuit.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the Inuit had killed a whale and were busy cutting
it up and carrying the meat and the blubber to their huts. Though
Ititaujang was hard at work his wife stood lazily by. When he called her
and asked her to help as the other women did she objected, crying, “My
food is not from the sea; my food is from the land; I&nbsp;will not eat
the meat of a whale; I&nbsp;will not help.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page617" id =
"page617">617</a></span>
<p>Ititaujang answered, “You must eat of the whale; that will fill your
stomach.” Then she began crying and exclaimed, “I&nbsp;will not eat it;
I&nbsp;will not soil my nice white clothing.”</p>

<p>She descended to the beach, eagerly looking for birds’ feathers.
Having found a few she put them between her fingers and between those of
her child; both were transformed into geese and flew away.</p>

<p>When the Inuit saw this they called out, “Ititaujang, your wife is
flying away.” Ititaujang became very sad; he cried for his wife and did
not care for the abundance of meat and blubber, nor for the whales
spouting near the shore. He followed his wife and ascended the land in
search of her.</p>

<p>After having traveled for many weary months he came to a river. There
he saw a man who was busy chopping chips from a piece of wood with a
large hatchet. As soon as the chips fell off he polished them neatly and
they were transformed into salmon, becoming so slippery that they glided
from his hands and fell into the river, which they descended to a large
lake near by. The name of the man was Eχaluqdjung (the little
salmon).</p>

<p>On approaching, Ititaujang was frightened almost to death, for he saw
that the back of this man was altogether hollow and that he could look
from behind right through his mouth. Cautiously he crept back and by a
circuitous way approached him from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>When Eχaluqdjung saw him coming he stopped chopping and asked, “Which
way did you approach me?” Ititaujang, pointing in the direction he had
come last and from which he could not see the hollow back of
Eχaluqdjung, answered, “It is there I have come from.” Eχaluqdjung, on
hearing this, said, “That is lucky for you. If you had come from the
other side and had seen my back I should have immediately killed you
with my hatchet.” Ititaujang was very glad that he had turned back and
thus deceived the salmon maker. He asked him, “Have you not seen my
wife, who has left me, coming this way?” Eχaluqdjung had seen her and
said, “Do you see yon little island in the large lake? There she lives
now and has taken another husband.”</p>

<p>When Ititaujang heard this report he almost despaired, as he did not
know how to reach the island; but Eχaluqdjung kindly promised to help
him. They descended to the beach; Eχaluqdjung gave him the backbone of a
salmon and said, “Now shut your eyes. The backbone will turn into a
kayak and carry you safely to the island. But mind you do not open your
eyes, else the boat will upset.”</p>

<p>Ititaujang promised to obey. He shut his eyes, the backbone became a
kayak, and away he went over the lake. As he did not hear any splashing
of water, he was anxious to see whether the boat moved on, and opened
his eyes just a little. But he had scarcely taken a short glimpse when
the kayak began to swing violently and he felt
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page618" id =
"page618">618</a></span>
that it became a backbone again. He quickly shut his eyes, the boat went
steadily on, and a short time after he was landed on the island.</p>

<p>There he saw the hut and his son playing on the beach near it. The
boy on looking up saw Ititaujang and ran to his mother crying, “Mother,
father is here and is coming to our hut.” The mother answered, “Go, play
on; your father is far away and cannot find us.” The child obeyed; but
as he saw Ititaujang approaching he re-entered the hut and said,
“Mother, father is here and is coming to our hut.” Again the mother sent
him away, but he returned very soon, saying that Ititaujang was quite
near.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the boy said so when Ititaujang opened the door. When
the new husband saw him he told his wife to open a box which was in a
corner of the hut. She did so, and many feathers flew out of it and
stuck to them. The woman, her new husband, and the child were thus again
transformed into geese. The hut disappeared; but when Ititaujang saw
them about to fly away he got furious and cut open the belly of his wife
before she could escape. Then many eggs fell down.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_sagdlirmiut" id = "tales_sagdlirmiut">THE
EMIGRATION OF THE SAGDLIRMIUT.</a></h4>

<p>In the beginning all the Inuit lived near Ussualung, in
Tiniqdjuarbing (Cumberland Sound). The Igdlumiut, the Nugumiut, and the
Talirpingmiut in the south, the Aggomiut in the far north, and the
Inuit, who tattoo rings round their eyes, in the far west, all once
lived together. There is a tradition concerning the emigration of the
Sagdlirmiut (see <a href = "#page451">p.&nbsp;451</a>) who live east of
Iglulik. The Akudnirmiut say that the following events did not happen in
Tiniqdjuarbing, but in Aggo, a&nbsp;country where nobody lives nowadays.
Ikeraping, an Akudnirmio, heard the story related by a Tununirmio, who
had seen the place himself, but all the Oqomiut assert that Ussualung is
the place where the events in the story happened.</p>

<p>An old woman, the sister of Mitiq, the angakoq, told the story as
follows:</p>

<p>Near Ussualung there are two places, Qerniqdjuaq and Eχaluqdjuaq. In
each of these was a large house, in which many families lived together.
They used to keep company during the summer when they went deer hunting,
but returned to their separate houses in the fall.</p>

<p>Once upon a time it happened that the men of Qerniqdjuaq had been
very successful, while those of Eχaluqdjuaq had caught scarcely any
deer. Therefore the latter got very angry and resolved to kill the other
party, but they preferred to wait until the winter. Later in the season
many deer were caught and put up in depots. They were to be carried down
to the winter settlements by means of sledges.</p>

<p>One day both parties agreed upon a journey to these depots and the
men of Eχaluqdjuaq resolved to kill their enemies on this occasion.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page619" id =
"page619">619</a></span>
They set out with their dogs and sledges, and when they were fairly
inland they suddenly attacked their unsuspecting companions and killed
them. For fear that the wives and children of the murdered men might be
suspicious if the dogs returned without their masters, they killed them
too. After a short time they returned and said they had lost the other
party and did not know what had happened to them.</p>

<p>A young man of Eχaluqdjuaq was the suitor of a girl of Qerniqdjuaq
and used to visit her every night. He did not stop his visits now. He
was kindly received by the woman and lay down to sleep with his young
wife.</p>

<p>Under the snow bench there was a little boy who had seen the young
man of Eχaluqdjuaq coming. When everybody was sleeping he heard somebody
calling and soon recognized the spirits of the murdered men, who told
him what had happened and asked him to kill the young man in revenge.
The boy crept from his place under the bed, took a knife, and put it
into the young man’s breast. As he was a small boy and very weak, the
knife glided from the ribs and entered deep into the heart, thus killing
the young man.</p>

<p>Then he roused the other inhabitants of the hut and told them that
the spirits of the dead men had come to him, that they had told him of
their murder, and had ordered him to kill the young man. The women and
children got very much frightened and did not know what to do. At last
they resolved to follow the advice of an old woman and to flee from
their cruel neighbors. As their dogs were killed, the sledges were of no
use, but by chance a bitch with pups was in the hut and the old woman,
who was a great angakoq, ordered them to go and whip the young dogs,
which would thus grow up quickly. They did so and in a short time the
pups were large and strong. They harnessed them and set off as quickly
as possible. In order to deceive their neighbors they left everything
behind and did not even extinguish their lamps, that they might not
excite suspicion.</p>

<p>The next morning the men of Eχaluqdjuaq wondered why their companion
had not returned and went to the hut in Qernirtung. They peeped through
the spy hole in the window and saw the lamps burning, but nobody inside.
At last they discovered the body of the young man, and, finding the
tracks of the sledges, they hurriedly put their sledges in order and
pursued the fugitives.</p>

<p>Though the latter had journeyed rapidly their pursuers followed still
more rapidly and seemed likely to overtake them in a short time. They
therefore became very much frightened, fearing the revenge of their
pursuers.</p>

<p>When the sledge of the men drew near and the women saw that they were
unable to escape, a&nbsp;young woman asked the old angakoq: “Don’t you
know how to cut the ice?” The matron answered in the affirmative and
slowly drew a line over the ice with her first finger
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page620" id =
"page620">620</a></span>
across the path of their pursuers. The ice gave a loud crack. Once more
she drew the line, when a crack opened and quickly widened as she passed
on. The floe began moving and when the men arrived they could not cross
over the wide space of water. Thus the party were saved by the art of
their angakoq.</p>

<p>For many days they drifted to and fro, but finally they landed on the
island of Sagdlirn, where they took up their abode and became the
mothers of the Sagdlirmiut.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_kalopaling" id =
"tales_kalopaling">KALOPALING.</a></h4>

<p>Kalopaling is a fabulous being that lives in the sea. His body is
like that of a human being and he wears clothing made of eider ducks’
skins. Therefore he is sometimes called Mitiling (with eider ducks). As
these birds have a black back and a white belly, his gown looked
speckled all over. His jacket has an enormous hood, which is an object
of fear to the Inuit. If a kayak capsizes and the boatman is drowned
Kalopaling puts him into this hood. He cannot speak, but can only cry,
“Be, be! Be, be!” His feet are very large and look like inflated
sealskin floats.</p>

<p>The Inuit believe that in olden times there were a great number of
Kalopalit, but gradually their number diminished and there are now very
few left. They may be seen from the land swimming very rapidly under the
water and sometimes rising to the surface. While swimming they make a
great noise by splashing with arms and legs. In summer they like to bask
on rocks and in winter they sometimes sit on the ice near cracks or at
the edge of drifting floes. As they pursue the hunters the most daring
men try to kill them whenever they can get near them. Cautiously they
approach the sleeping Kalopaling, and as soon as they come near enough
they throw the walrus harpoon at him. They must shut their eyes
immediately until the Kalopaling is dead, else he will capsize the boat
and kill the hunters. The flesh of the Kalopaling is said to be
poisonous, but good enough for dog’s food.</p>

<p>An old tradition is handed down which refers to a Kalopaling:</p>

<p>An old woman lived with her grandson in a small hut. As they had no
kinsmen they were very poor. A&nbsp;few Inuit only took pity on them and
brought them seal’s meat and blubber for their lamps. Once upon a time
they were very hungry and the boy cried. The grandmother told him to be
quiet, but as he did not obey she became angry and called Kalopaling to
come and take him away. He entered at once and the woman put the boy
into the large hood, in which he disappeared almost immediately.</p>

<p>Later on the Inuit were more successful in sealing and they had an
abundance of meat. Then the grandmother was sorry that she had so rashly
given the boy to Kalopaling and wished to see him back
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page621" id =
"page621">621</a></span>
again. She lamented about it to the Inuit, and at length a man and his
wife promised to help her.</p>

<p>When the ice had consolidated and deep cracks were formed near the
shore by the rise and fall of the tide, the boy used to rise and sit
alongside the cracks, playing with a whip of seaweed. Kalopaling,
however, was afraid that somebody might carry the boy away and had
fastened him to a string of seaweed, which he held in his hands. The
Inuit who had seen the boy went toward him, but as soon as he saw them
coming he sang, “Two men are coming, one with a double jacket, the other
with a foxskin jacket” (Inung maqong tikitong, aipa mirqosailing, aipa
kapiteling). Then Kalopaling pulled on the rope and the boy disappeared.
He did not want to return to his grandmother, who had abused him.</p>

<p>Some time afterward the Inuit saw him again sitting near a crack.
They took the utmost caution that he should not hear them when
approaching, tying pieces of deerskin under the soles of their boots.
But when they could almost lay hold of the boy he sang, “Two men are
coming, one with a double jacket, the other with a foxskin jacket.”
Again Kalopaling pulled on the seaweed rope and the boy disappeared.</p>

<p>The man and his wife, however, did not give up trying. They resolved
to wait near the crack, and on one occasion when the boy had just come
out of the water they jumped forward from a piece of ice behind which
they had been hidden and before he could give the alarm they had cut the
rope and away they went with him to their huts.</p>

<p>The boy lived with them and became a great hunter.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_uissuit" id = "tales_uissuit">THE UISSUIT.</a></h4>

<p>Besides the Kalopalit there are the Uissuit, a strange people that
live in the sea. They are dwarfs and are frequently seen between Iglulik
and Netchillik, where the Anganidjen live, an Inuit tribe whose women
are in the habit of tattooing rings around their eyes. There are men and
women among the Uissuit and they live in deep water, never coming up to
the surface. When the Inuit wish to see them, they go in their boats to
a place where they cannot see the bottom and try to catch them by hooks
which they slowly move up and down. As soon as they get a bite they draw
in the line. The Uissuit are thus drawn up; but no sooner do they
approach the surface than they dive down headlong again, only their legs
having emerged from the water. The Inuit have never succeeded in getting
one out of the water.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_kiviung" id = "tales_kiviung">KIVIUNG.</a></h4>

<p>An old woman lived with her grandson in a small hut. As she had no
husband and no son to take care of her and the boy, they were very poor,
the boy’s clothing being made of skins of birds which
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page622" id =
"page622">622</a></span>
they caught in snares. When the boy would come out of the hut and join
his playfellows, the men would laugh at him and tear his outer garment.
Only one man, whose name was Kiviung, was kind to the young boy; but he
could not protect him from the others. Often the lad came to his
grandmother crying and weeping, and she always consoled him and each
time made him a new garment. She entreated the men to stop teasing the
boy and tearing his clothing, but they would not listen to her prayer.
At last she got angry and swore she would take revenge upon his abusers,
and she could easily do so, as she was a great angakoq.</p>

<p>She commanded her grandson to step into a puddle which was on the
floor of the hut, telling him what would happen and how he should
behave. As soon as he stood in the water the earth opened and he sank
out of sight, but the next moment he rose near the beach as a yearling
seal with a beautiful skin and swam about lustily.</p>

<p>The men had barely seen the seal when they took to their kayaks,
eager to secure the pretty animal. But the transformed boy quickly swam
away, as his grandmother had told him, and the men continued in pursuit.
Whenever he rose to breathe he took care to come up behind the kayaks,
where the men could not get at him with their harpoons; there, however,
he splashed and dabbled in order to attract their attention and lure
them on. But before any one could turn his kayak he had dived again and
swam away. The men were so interested in the pursuit that they did not
observe that they were being led far from the coast and that the land
was now altogether invisible.</p>

<p>Suddenly a gale arose; the sea foamed and roared and the waves
destroyed or upset their frail vessels. After all seemed to be drowned
the seal was again transformed into the lad, who went home without
wetting his feet. There was nobody now to tear his clothing, all his
abusers being dead.</p>

<p>Only Kiviung, who was a great angakoq and had never abused the boy,
had escaped the wind and waves. Bravely he strove against the wild sea,
but the storm did not abate. After he had drifted for many days on the
wide sea, a&nbsp;dark mass loomed up through the mist. His hope revived
and he worked hard to reach the supposed land. The nearer he came,
however, the more agitated did the sea become, and he saw that he had
mistaken a wild, black sea, with raging whirlpools, for land. Barely
escaping he drifted again for many days, but the storm did not abate and
he did not see any land. Again he saw a dark mass looming up through the
mist, but he was once more deceived, for it was another whirlpool which
made the sea rise in gigantic waves.</p>

<p>At last the storm moderated, the sea subsided, and at a great
distance he saw the land. Gradually he came nearer and following the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page623" id =
"page623">623</a></span>
coast he at length spied a stone house in which a light was burning. He
landed and entered the house. Nobody was inside but an old woman whose
name was Arnaitiang. She received him kindly and at his request pulled
off his boots, slippers, and stockings and dried them on the frame
hanging over the lamp. Then she went out to light a fire and cook a good
meal.</p>

<p>When the stockings were dry, Kiviung tried to take them from the
frame in order to put them on, but as soon as he extended his hand to
touch them the frame rose out of his reach. Having tried several times
in vain, he called Arnaitiang and asked her to give him back the
stockings. She answered: “Take them yourself; there they are; there they
are” and went out again. The fact is she was a very bad woman and wanted
to eat Kiviung.</p>

<p>Then he tried once more to take hold of his stockings, but with no
better result. He called again for Arnaitiang and asked her to give him
the boots and stockings, whereupon she said: “Sit down where I sat when
you entered my house; then you can get them.” After that she left him
again. Kiviung tried it once more, but the frame rose as before and he
could not reach it.</p>

<p>Now he understood that Arnaitiang meditated mischief; so he summoned
his tornaq, a&nbsp;huge white bear, who arose roaring from under the
floor of the house. At first Arnaitiang did not hear him, but as Kiviung
kept on conjuring the spirit came nearer and nearer to the surface, and
when she heard his loud roar she rushed in trembling with fear and gave
Kiviung what he had asked for. “Here are your boots,” she cried; “here
are your slippers; here are your stockings. I’ll help you put them on.”
But Kiviung would not stay any longer with this horrid witch and did not
even dare to put on his boots, but took them from Arnaitiang and rushed
out of the door. He had barely escaped when it clapped violently
together and just caught the tail of his jacket, which was torn off. He
hastened to his kayak without once stopping to look behind and paddled
away. He had only gone a short distance before Arnaitiang, who had
recovered from her fear, came out swinging her glittering woman’s knife
and threatening to kill him. He was nearly frightened to death and
almost upset his kayak. However, he managed to balance it again and
cried in answer, lifting up his spear: “I&nbsp;shall kill you with my
spear.” When Arnaitiang heard these words she fell down terror stricken
and broke her knife. Kiviung then observed that it was made of a thin
slab of fresh water ice.</p>

<p>He traveled on for many days and nights, following the shore. At last
he came to a hut, and again a lamp was burning inside. As his clothing
was wet and he was hungry, he landed and entered the house. There he
found a woman who lived all alone with her daughter. Her son-in-law was
a log of driftwood which had four boughs. Every day about the time of
low water they carried it to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page624" id =
"page624">624</a></span>
the beach and when the tide came in it swam away. When night came again
it returned with eight large seals, two being fastened to every bough.
Thus the timber provided its wife, her mother, and Kiviung with an
abundance of food. One day, however, after they had launched it as they
had always done, it left and never returned.</p>

<p>After a short interval Kiviung married the young widow. Now he went
sealing every day himself and was very successful. As he thought of
leaving some day, he was anxious to get a good stock of mittens (that
his hands might keep dry during the long journey?). Every night after
returning from hunting he pretended to have lost his mittens. In reality
he had concealed them in the hood of his jacket.</p>

<p>After <ins class = "correction" title = "printed as shown (one word)">awhile</ins> the old woman became jealous of her daughter, for
the new husband of the latter was a splendid hunter and she wished to
marry him herself. One day when he was away hunting, she murdered her
daughter, and in order to deceive him she removed her daughter’s skin
and crept into it, thus changing her shape into that of the young woman.
When Kiviung returned, she went to meet him, as it had been her
daughter’s custom, and without exciting any suspicion. But when he
entered the hut and saw the bones of his wife he at once became aware of
the cruel deed and of the deception that had been practiced and fled
away.</p>

<p>He traveled on for many days and nights, always following the shore.
At last he again came to a hut where a lamp was burning. As his clothing
was wet and he was hungry, he landed and went up to the house. Before
entering it occurred to him that it would be best to find out first who
was inside. He therefore climbed up to the window and looked through the
peep hole. On the bed sat an old woman, whose name was Aissivang
(spider). When she saw the dark figure before the window she believed it
was a cloud passing the sun, and as the light was insufficient to enable
her to go on with her work she got angry. With her knife she cut away
her eyebrows, ate them, and did not mind the dripping blood, but sewed
on. When Kiviung saw this he thought that she must be a very bad woman
and turned away.</p>

<p>Still he traveled on days and nights. At last he came to a land which
seemed familiar to him and soon he recognized his own country. He was
very glad when he saw some boats coming to meet him. They had been on a
whaling excursion and were towing a great carcass to the village. In the
bow of one of them stood a stout young man who had killed the whale. He
was Kiviung’s son, whom he had left a small boy and who was now grown up
and had become a great hunter. His wife had taken a new husband, but now
she returned to Kiviung.</p>

<h4><a name = "tales_narwhal" id = "tales_narwhal">ORIGIN OF THE
NARWHAL.</a></h4>

<p>A long, long time ago a widow lived with her daughter and her son in
a hut. When the boy was quite young he made a bow and arrows of walrus
tusks and shot birds, which they ate. Before he was grown up he
accidentally became blind. From that moment his mother maltreated him in
every way. She never gave him enough to eat, though he had formerly
added a great deal to their sustenance, and did not allow her daughter,
who loved her brother tenderly, to give him anything. Thus they lived
many years and the poor boy was very unhappy.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a polar bear came to the hut and thrust his head
right through the window. They were all very much frightened and the
mother gave the boy his bow and arrows that he might kill the animal.
But he said, “I&nbsp;cannot see the window and I shall miss him.” Then
the sister leveled the bow and the boy shot and killed the bear. The
mother and sister went out and took the carcass down and skinned it.</p>

<p>After they had returned into the hut they told the boy that he had
missed the bear, which had run away when it had seen him taking his bow
and arrows. The bad mother had strictly ordered her daughter not to tell
that the bear was dead, and she did not dare to disobey. The mother and
the daughter ate the bear and had an ample supply of food, while the boy
was almost starving. Sometimes, when the mother had gone away, the girl
gave her brother something to eat, as she loved him dearly.</p>

<p>One day a loon flew over the hut and observing the poor blind boy it
resolved to restore his eyesight. It sat down on the top of the roof and
cried, “Come out, boy, and follow me.” When he heard this he crept out
and followed the bird, which flew along to a lake. There it took the boy
and dived with him to the bottom. When they had risen again to the
surface it asked, “Can you see anything?” The boy answered, “No,
I&nbsp;cannot yet see.” They dived again and staid a long time in the
water. When they emerged, the bird asked, “Can you see now?” The boy
answered, “I&nbsp;see a dim shimmer.” Then they dived the third time and
staid very long under water. When they had risen to the surface the boy
had recovered his eyesight altogether.</p>

<p>He was very glad and thankful to the bird, which told him to return
to the hut. Then he found the skin of the bear he had killed drying in
the warm rays of the sun. He got very angry and cut it into small
pieces. He entered the hut and asked his mother: “From whom did you get
the bearskin I saw outside of the hut?” The mother was frightened when
she found that her son had recovered his eyesight, and prevaricated. She
said, “Come here, I&nbsp;will give
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page626" id =
"page626">626</a></span>
you the best I have; but I am very poor; I&nbsp;have no supporter; come
here, eat this, it is very good.” The boy, however, did not comply and
asked again, “From whom did you get yon bearskin I saw outside the hut?”
Again she prevaricated; but when she could no longer evade the question
she said, “A&nbsp;boat came here with many men in it, who left it for
me.”</p>

<p>The boy did not believe the story, but was sure that it was the skin
of the bear he had killed during the winter. However, he did not say a
word. His mother, who was anxious to conciliate him, tried to
accommodate him with food and clothing, but he did not accept
anything.</p>

<p>He went to the other Inuit who lived in the same village, made a
spear and a harpoon of the same pattern he saw in use with them, and
began to catch white whales. In a short time he had become an expert
hunter.</p>

<p>By and by he thought of taking revenge on his mother. He said to his
sister, “Mother abused me when I was blind and has maltreated you for
pitying me; we will revenge ourselves on her.” The sister agreed and he
planned a scheme for killing the mother.</p>

<p>When he went to hunt white whales he used to wind the harpoon line
round his body and, taking a firm footing, hold the animal until it was
dead. Sometimes his sister accompanied him and helped him to hold the
line.</p>

<p>One day he told his mother to go with him and hold his line. When
they came to the beach he tied the rope round her body and asked her to
keep a firm footing. She was rather anxious, as she had never done this
before, and told him to harpoon a small dolphin, else she might not be
able to resist the strong pull. After a short time a young animal came
up to breathe and the mother shouted, “Kill it, I&nbsp;can hold it;” but
the boy answered, “No, it is too large.” Again a small dolphin came near
and the mother shouted to him to spear it; but he said, “No, it is too
large.” At last a huge animal rose quite near. Immediately he threw his
harpoon, taking care not to kill it, and tossing his mother forward into
the water cried out, “That is because you maltreated me; that is because
you abused me.”</p>

<p>The white whale dragged the mother into the sea, and whenever she
rose to the surface she cried, “Louk! Louk!” and gradually she became
transformed into a narwhal.</p>

<p>After the young man had taken revenge he began to realize that it was
his mother whom he had murdered and he was haunted by remorse, and so
was his sister, as she had agreed to the bad plans of her brother. They
did not dare to stay any longer in their hut, but left the country and
traveled many days and many nights overland. At last they came to a
place where they saw a hut in which a man lived whose name was
Qitua´jung. He was very bad and had horribly long nails on his fingers.
The young man, being very thirsty,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page627" id =
"page627">627</a></span>
sent his sister into the hut to ask for some water. She entered and said
to Qitua´jung, who sat on the bed place, “My brother asks for some
water;” to which Qitua´jung responded, “There it stands behind the lamp.
Take as much as you like.” She stooped to the bucket, when he jumped up
and tore her back with his long nails. Then she called to her brother
for help, crying, “Brother, brother, that man is going to kill me.” The
young man ran to the hut immediately, broke down the roof, and killed
the bad man with his spear.</p>

<p>Cautiously he wrapped up his sister in hares’ skins, put her on his
back, and traveled on. He wandered over the land for many days, until he
came to a hut in which a man lived whose name was Iqignang. As the young
man was very hungry, he asked him if he might eat a morsel from the
stock of deer meat put up in the entrance of the hut. Iqignang answered,
“Don’t eat it, don’t eat it.” Though he had already taken a little bit,
he immediately stopped. Iqignang was very kind to the brother and
sister, however, and after a short time he married the girl, who had
recovered from her wounds, and gave his former wife to the young man.<a

<h4><a name = "tales_visitor" id = "tales_visitor">THE VISITOR.</a></h4>

<p>An old hag lived in a house with her grandson. She was a very bad
woman who thought of nothing but playing mischief. She was a witch and
tried to harm everybody by witchcraft. Once upon a time a stranger came
to visit some friends who lived in a hut near that of the old woman. As
the visitor was a good hunter and procured plenty of food for his hosts,
she envied them and resolved to kill the new comer. She made a soup of
wolf’s and man’s brains, which was the most poisonous meal she could
prepare, and sent her grandson to invite the stranger. She cautioned him
not to say what she had cooked, as she knew that the visitor was a great
angakoq, who was by far her superior in wisdom.</p>

<p>The boy went to the neighboring hut and said: “Stranger, my
grandmother invites you to come to her hut and to have there a good
feast on a supper she has cooked. She told me not to say that it is a
man’s and a wolf’s brains and I do not say it.”</p>

<p>Though the angakoq understood the schemes of the old hag he followed
the boy and sat down with her. She feigned to be very glad to see him
and gave him a dish full of soup, which he began to eat. But by help of
his tornaq the food fell right through him into a vessel which he had
put between his feet on the floor of the hut. This he gave to the old
witch and compelled her to eat it. She died as soon as she had brought
the first spoonful to her mouth.</p>

WOMEN.</a></h4>

<p>Once upon a time two women who were with child quarreled with their
husbands and fled from their families and friends to live by themselves.
After having traveled a long distance they came to a place called
Igdluqdjuaq, where they resolved to stay. It was summer when they
arrived. They found plenty of sod and turf and large whale ribs
bleaching on the beach. They erected a firm structure of bones and
filled the interstices with sod and turf. Thus they had a good house to
live in. In order to obtain skins they made traps, in which they caught
foxes in sufficient numbers for their dresses. Sometimes they found
carcasses of ground seals or of whales which had drifted to the shore,
of which they ate the meat and burnt the blubber. There was also a deep
and narrow deer pass near the hut. Across this they stretched a rope and
when the deer passed by they became entangled in it and strangled
themselves. Besides, there was a salmon creek near the house and this
likewise furnished them with an abundance of food.</p>

<p>In winter their fathers came in search of their lost daughters. When
they saw the sledge coming they began to cry, as they were unwilling to
return to their husbands. The men, however, were glad to find them
comfortable, and having staid two nights at their daughters’ house they
returned home, where they told the strange story that two women without
the company of any men lived all by themselves and were never in
want.</p>

<p>Though this happened a long time ago the house may still be seen and
therefore the place is called Igdluqdjuaq (The Large House).</p>

<h5><a name = "tales_qau_brothers" id = "tales_qau_brothers">I. STORY OF
THE THREE BROTHERS.</a></h5>

<p>A long time ago there lived three brothers. Two of them were grown
up, but the third was a young lad whose name was Qaudjaqdjuq. The elder
brothers had left their country and traveled about many years, while the
youngest lived with his mother in their native village. As they had no
supporter, the poor youth was abused by all the men of the village and
there was nobody to protect him.</p>

<p>At last the elder brothers, being tired of roaming about, returned
home. When they heard that the boy had been badly used by all the Inuit
they became angry and thought of revenge. At first, however, they did
not say anything, but built a boat, in which they intended to escape
after having accomplished their designs. They were skillful boat
builders and finished their work very soon. They tried the boat and
found that it passed over the water as swiftly as an eider duck flies.
As they were not content with their work they destroyed it again and
built a new boat, which proved as swift as
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page629" id =
"page629">629</a></span>
an ice duck. They were not yet content, destroyed this, and built a
third one that was good. After having finished the boat they lived
quietly with the other men. In the village there was a large singing
house, which was used at every festival. One day the three brothers
entered it and shut it up. Then they began dancing and singing and
continued until they were exhausted. As there was no seat in the house
they asked their mother to bring one, and when they opened the door to
let her pass in, an ermine, which had been hidden in the house,
escaped.</p>

<p>Near the singing house the other Inuit of the village were playing.
When they saw the ermine, which ran right through the crowd, they
endeavored to catch it. In the eagerness of pursuit one man, who had
almost caught the little animal, stumbled over a bowlder and fell in
such a manner that he was instantly killed. The ermine was sprinkled
with blood, particularly about its mouth. During the ensuing confusion
it escaped into the singing house, where it concealed itself again in
the same corner.</p>

<p>The brothers, who were inside, had recommenced singing and dancing.
When they were exhausted they called for their mother (to&nbsp;bring
something to eat). When they opened the door the ermine again escaped
and ran about among the Inuit, who were still playing outside.</p>

<p>When they saw it they believed that the brothers would induce them to
pursue it again, and thus make them perish one by one. Therefore the
whole crowd stormed the singing house with the intention of killing the
brothers. As the door was shut they climbed on the roof and pulled it
down, but when they took up their spears to pierce the three men they
opened the door and rushed down to the beach. Their boat was quite near
at hand and ready to be launched, while those of the other Inuit were a
long distance off.</p>

<p>They embarked with their mother, but, when they were at a short
distance and saw that the other men had not yet reached their boats,
they pretended that they were unable to move theirs, though they pulled
with the utmost effort. In reality, they played with the oars on the
water. A&nbsp;few young women and girls were on the shore looking at the
brothers, who seemed to exert themselves to the utmost of their
strength. The eldest brother cried to the women: “Will you help us? We
cannot get along alone.” Two girls consented, but as soon as they had
come into the boat the brothers commenced pulling as hard as possible,
the boat flying along quicker than a duck, while the girls cried with
fright. The other Inuit hastened up desirous to reach the fugitives, and
soon their boats were manned.</p>

<p>The brothers were not afraid, however, as their boat was by far the
swiftest. When they had almost lost sight of the pursuers they were
suddenly stopped by a high, bold land rising before the boat and
shutting up their way. They were quite puzzled, as they had to
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page630" id =
"page630">630</a></span>
retrace their way for a long distance and feared they would be overtaken
by the other boats. But one of the brothers, who was a great angakoq,
saved them by his art. He said: “Shut your eyes and do not open them
before I tell you, and then pull on.” They did as they were bade, and
when he told them to look up they saw that they had sailed right through
the land, which rose just as high and formidable behind them as it had
formerly obstructed their way. It had opened and let them pass.</p>

<p>After having sailed some time they saw a long black line in the sea.
On coming nearer they discovered that it was an impenetrable mass of
seaweed, so compact that they could leave the boat and stand upon it.
There was no chance of pushing the boat through, though it was swifter
than a duck. The eldest brother, however, thought of his angakoq art and
said to his mother, “Take your hair lace and whip the seaweed.” As soon
as she did so it sank and opened the way.</p>

<p>After having overcome these obstacles they were troubled no more and
accomplished their journey in safety. When they arrived in their country
they went ashore and erected a hut. The two women whom they had taken
from their enemies they gave to their young brother Qaudjaqdjuq.</p>

<p>They wanted to make him a very strong man, such as they were
themselves. For this reason they led him to a huge stone and said, “Try
to lift that stone.” As Qaudjaqdjuq was unable to do so, they whipped
him and said, “Try it again.” Now Qaudjaqdjuq could move it a little
from its place. The brothers were not yet content and whipped him once
more. By the last whipping he became very strong and lifted the bowlder
and cast it over the hut.</p>

<p>Then the brothers gave him the whip and told him to beat his wives if
they disobeyed him.</p>

QAUDJAQDJUQ.</a></h5>

<p>A long time ago there was a poor little orphan boy who had no
protector and was maltreated by all the inhabitants of the village. He
was not even allowed to sleep in the hut, but lay outside in the cold
passage among the dogs, who were his pillows and his quilt. Neither did
they give him any meat, but flung old, tough walrus hide at him, which
he was compelled to eat without a knife. A&nbsp;young girl was the only
one who pitied him. She gave him a very small piece of iron for a knife,
but bade him conceal it well or the men would take it from him. He did
so, putting it into his urethra. Thus he led a miserable life and did
not grow at all, but remained poor little Qaudjaqdjuq. He did not even
dare to join the plays of the other children, as they also maltreated
and abused him on account of his weakness.</p>

<p>When the inhabitants assembled in the singing house Qaudjaqdjuq used
to lie in the passage and peep over the threshold. Now and then a man
would lift him by the nostrils into the hut and give him the large urine
vessel to carry out (Fig. 537). It was so large and heavy
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page632" id =
"page632">632</a></span>
that he was obliged to take hold of it with both hands and his teeth. As
he was frequently lifted by the nostrils they grew to be very large,
though he remained small and weak.</p>

<p>At last the man in the moon,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id =
"tag11" href = "#note11">11</a> who had seen how badly the men behaved
towards Qaudjaqdjuq, came down to help him. He harnessed his dog<a class

Tirie´tiang to his sledge and drove down. When near the hut he stopped
and cried, “Qaudjaqdjuq, come out.” Qaudjaqdjuq answered, “I&nbsp;will
not come out. Go away!” But when he had asked him a second and a third
time to come out, he complied, though he was very much frightened. Then
the man in the moon went with him to a place where some large bowlders
were lying about and, having whipped him (Fig. 539), asked, “Do you feel
stronger now?” Qaudjaqdjuq answered: “Yes, I&nbsp;feel stronger.” “Then
lift yon bowlder,” said he. As Qaudjaqdjuq was not yet able to lift it,
he gave him another whipping, and now all of a sudden he began to grow,
the feet first becoming of an extraordinary size (Fig. 540). Again the
man in the moon asked him: “Do you feel stronger now?” Qaudjaqdjuq
answered: “Yes, I&nbsp;feel stronger;” but as he could not yet lift the
stone he was whipped once more, after which he had attained a very great
strength and lifted the bowlder as if it were a small pebble. The man in
the moon said: “That will do. To-morrow morning I shall send three
bears; then you may show your strength.”</p>

<p>He returned to the moon, but Qaudjaqdjuq, who had now become
Qaudjuqdjuaq (the big Qaudjaqdjuq), returned home tossing the stones
with his feet and making them fly to the right and to the left. At night
he lay down again among the dogs to sleep. Next morning he awaited the
bears, and, indeed, three large animals soon made their appearance,
frightening all the men, who did not dare to leave the huts.</p>

<p>Then Qaudjuqdjuaq put on his boots and ran down to the ice. The men
who looked out of the window hole said, “Look here, is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page633" id =

not that Qaudjaqdjuq? The bears will soon make way with him.” But he
seized the first by its hind legs and smashed its head on an iceberg,
near which it happened to stand. The other one fared no better; the
third, however, he carried up to the village and slew some of his
persecutors with it. Others he pressed to death with his hands or tore
off their heads (Fig. 541), crying: “That is for abusing me; that is for
your maltreating me.” Those whom he did not kill ran away, never to
return. Only a few who had been kind to him while he had been poor
little Qaudjaqdjuq were spared, among them the girl who had given him
the knife. Qaudjuqdjuaq lived to be a great hunter and traveled all over
the country, accomplishing many exploits.</p>

<p>Igimarasugdjuqdjuaq was a very huge and bad man, who had committed
many murders and eaten the victims after he had cut them up with his
knife. Once upon a time his sister-in-law came to visit his wife, but
scarcely had she entered the hut before Igimarasugdjuqdjuaq killed her
and commanded his wife to cook her.</p>

<p>His wife was very much frightened, fearing that she herself would be
the next victim, and resolved to make her escape. When
Igimarasugdjuqdjuaq had left to go hunting she gathered heather, stuffed
her jacket with it, and placed the figure in a sitting position upon the
bed. Then she ran away as fast as she could and suc-ceeded
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page634" id =

in reaching a village. When her husband came home and saw the jacket he
believed that it was a stranger who had come to visit him and stabbed
him through the body. When he discovered, however, that his wife had
deceived and left him, he fell into a passion and pursued her.</p>

<p>He came to the village and said: “Have you seen my wife? She has run
away.” The Inuit did not tell him that she was staying with them, but
concealed her from his wrath. At last Igimarasugdjuqdjuaq gave her up
for lost and returned home.</p>

<p>The Inuit, however, resolved to revenge the many outrages which he
had wrought upon them. They went to visit him and met him on the ice
just below the hut. When he told them he was going bear hunting they
said: “Let us see your spear.” This spear had a stout and sharp walrus
tusk for a point. “Ah,” said they; “that is good for bear hunting; how
sharp it is. You must hit him just this way.” And so saying they struck
his brow, the point of the spear entering his brain, and then cut the
body up with their knives.</p>

<p>In olden times the Inuit were not the only inhabitants of the country
in which they live at the present time. Another tribe similar to them
shared their hunting ground. But they were on good terms, both tribes
living in harmony in the villages. The Tornit were much taller than the
Inuit and had very long legs and arms. Almost all of them were blear
eyed. They were extremely strong and could lift large bowlders, which
were by far too heavy for the Inuit. But even the Inuit of that time
were much stronger than those of to-day, and some large stones are shown
on the plain of Miliaqdjuin, in Cumberland Sound, with which the ancient
Inuit used to play, throwing them great distances. Even the strongest
men of the present generations are scarcely able to lift them, much less
to swing them or throw them any distance.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Fig. 542.</span> Tumiujang<br>
or lamp of the Tornit.<br>
(Museum für Volkerkunde,<br>
Berlin IV, A&nbsp;6848.)</p>
</div>

<p>The Tornit lived on walrus, seals, and deer, just as the Eskimo do
nowadays, but their methods of hunting were different. The principal
part of their winter dress was a long and wide coat of deerskins,
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page635" id =
"page635">635</a></span>
similar to the jumper of the Eskimo, but reaching down to the knees and
trimmed with leather straps. When sealing in winter they wore this
garment, the lower edge of which was fastened on the snow by means of
pegs. Under the jacket they carried a small lamp, called tumiujang
(literally, resembling a footprint) or quming (Fig. 542), over which
they melted snow in a small pot. Some Eskimo say that they opened the
seals as soon as they were caught and cooked some meat over these lamps.
When the seal blew in the hole they whispered, “Kapatipara”
(I&nbsp;shall stab&nbsp;it) and, when they had hit it, “Igdluiliq.”
Frequently they forgot about the lamp and in throwing the harpoon upset
it and burned their skin.</p>

<p>All their weapons were made of stone. For the blades of their knives
they used green slate (uluqsaq, literally material for women’s knives),
which was fastened by ivory pins to a bone or ivory handle.</p>

<p>The points of their harpoons were made of bone, ivory, or slate;
those of their lances, of flint or quartz, which was also used for
drillheads; and they made neither kayaks nor bows.</p>

<p>Their method of hunting deer was remarkable. In a deer pass, where
the game could not escape, they erected a file of cairns across the
valley and connected them by ropes. Some of the hunters hid behind the
cairns, while others drove the deer toward them. As the animals were
unable to pass the rope they fled along it, looking for an exit, and
while attempting to pass a cairn were lanced by the waiting hunter, who
seized the body by the hind legs and drew it behind the line.</p>

<p>This tale is related as a proof of their enormous strength and it is
said that they were able to hold a harpooned walrus as the Eskimo hold a
seal.</p>

<p>The Tornit could not clean the sealskins so well as the Inuit, but
worked them up with part of the blubber attached. Their way of preparing
meat was disgusting, since they let it become putrid and placed it
between the thigh and the belly to warm it.</p>

<p>The old stone houses of the Tornit can be seen everywhere. Generally
they did not build snow houses, but lived the whole winter in stone
buildings, the roofs of which were frequently supported by whale ribs.
Though the Eskimo built similar structures they can be easily
distinguished from one another, the bed of their huts being much larger
than that of the Tornit.</p>

<p>Though both tribes lived on very good terms, the Inuit did not like
to play at ball with the Tornit, as they were too strong and used large
balls, with which they hurt their playfellows severely.</p>

<p>A remarkable tradition is told referring to the emigration of this
people.</p>

<p>The Tornit did not build any kayaks, but as they were aware of the
advantages afforded by their use in hunting they stole the boats from
the Inuit, who did not dare to defend their property, the
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page636" id =
"page636">636</a></span>
Tornit being by far their superiors in strength. Once upon a time a
young Tuniq had taken the kayak of a young Inung without asking him and
had injured it by knocking in the bottom. The Inung got very angry and
ran a knife into the nape of the Tuniq’s neck while he was sleeping.
(According to another tradition he drilled a hole into his head; this
form is also recorded in Labrador.) The Tornit then became afraid that
the Inuit would kill them all and preferred to leave the country for
good. They assembled at Qernirtung (a&nbsp;place in Cumberland Sound),
and in order to deceive any pursuers they cut off the tails of their
jumpers and tied their hair into a bunch protruding from the crown of
the head.</p>

<p>In another form of the tradition it is said that while playing with
the Tornit a young Inung fell down and broke his neck. The Tornit feared
that the Inuit might take revenge upon them and left the country.</p>

<p>Many old ditties are sung which either treat of the Tornit or are
reported to have been sung by them. Some of them will be found in the
linguistic account connected with my journey.</p>

upon her undertaking.</p>

<p>She summoned the spirit, saying, “If you are in the house, come

I am.” Then the woman asked, “Where are your feet; where are your shins;
where are your thighs; where are your hips; where are your loins?” Every
time the spirit answered, “Here they are; there they are.” And she asked
further, “Where is your belly?” “Here it is,” answered the spirit.
“Where is your breast; where are your shoulders; where is your neck;
where is your head?” “Here it is; there it is;” but in touching the head

ascending higher and higher, finally being transformed into stars. The
bear became the star Nanuqdjung
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page637" id =
"page637">637</a></span>
(Betelgeuse); the pursuers, Udleqdjun (Orion’s belt); and the sledge,
Kamutiqdjung (Orion’s sword). The men continue the pursuit up to this
day; the boy, however, returned to the village and told how the men were
lost.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_origin" id = "tales_origin">ORIGIN OF THE ADLET AND
OF THE QADLUNAIT.</a></h4>

<p>Savirqong, an old man, lived alone with his daughter. Her name was
Niviarsiang (i.e., the girl), but as she would not take a husband she
was also called Uinigumissuitung (she who would not take a husband). She
refused all her suitors, but at last a dog, spotted white and red, whose
name was Ijirqang, won her affection and she took him for a husband.
They had ten children, five of whom were Adlet and five dogs. The lower
part of the body of the Adlet was that of a dog and hairy all over, the
soles excepted, while the upper part was that of a man. When the
children grew up they became very voracious, and as the dog Ijirqang did
not go out hunting at all, but let his father in law provide for the
whole family, it was difficult for Savirqong to feed them. Moreover, the
children were awfully clamorous and noisy; so at last the grandfather
got tired of it, put the whole family into his boat, and carried them to
a small island. He told the dog Ijirqang to come every day and fetch
meat.</p>

<p>Niviarsiang hung a pair of boots round his neck and he swam across
the narrow channel. But Savirqong, instead of giving him meat, filled
the boots with heavy stones, which drowned Ijirqang when he attempted to
return to the island.</p>

<p>The daughter thought of revenging the death of her husband. She sent
the young dogs to her father’s hut and let them gnaw off his feet and
hands. In return Savirqong, when Niviarsiang happened to be in his boat,
threw her overboard and cut off her fingers when she held to the
gunwale. As they fell into the sea they were transformed into seals and
whales. At last he allowed her to climb into the boat.</p>

<p>As she feared that her father might think of killing or maiming her
children, she ordered the Adlet to go inland, where they became the
ancestors of a numerous people. She made a boat for the young dogs,
setting up two sticks for masts in the soles of her boots, and sent the
puppies across the ocean. She sang: “Angnaijaja. When you arrive there
across the ocean you will make many things giving you joy. Angnaija.”
They arrived in the land beyond the sea and became the ancestors of the
Europeans.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_flood" id = "tales_flood">THE GREAT FLOOD.</a></h4>

<p>A long time ago the ocean suddenly began to rise, until it covered
the whole land. The water even rose to the top of the mountains and the
ice drifted over them. When the flood had subsided the ice
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page638" id =
"page638">638</a></span>
stranded and ever since forms an ice cap on the top of the mountains.
Many shellfish, fish, seal, and whales were left high and dry and their
shells and bones may be seen to this day. A&nbsp;great number of Inuit
died during this period, but many others, who had taken to their kayaks
when the water commenced to rise, were saved.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_inugpaq" id =
"tales_inugpaq">INUGPAQDJUQDJUALUNG.</a><a class = "tag" name = "tag14"
id = "tag14" href = "#note14">14</a></h4>

<p>In days of yore, an enormous man, whose name was Inugpaqdjuqdjualung,
lived in company with many other Inuit in a village on a large fjord. He
was so tall that he could straddle the fjord. He used to stand thus
every morning and wait for whales to pass beneath him. As soon as one
came along he stooped and caught it, just as another man would scoop up
some little thing that had fallen into the water, and he ate it as other
men eat a small piece of meat.</p>

<p>One day all the natives had manned their boats to hunt a whale.
Inugpaqdjuqdjualung at the time was sitting lazily near his hut, but
when he saw the efforts of the men he scooped both whale and boats from
the water and placed them upon the beach.</p>

<p>At another time, being tired from running about, he lay down on a
high hill to take a nap. The Inuit told him that a couple of huge bears
had been seen near the village, but he said he didn’t care, and told his
friends to rouse him by throwing large stones upon him if they should
see the bears coming. They did so and Inugpaqdjuqdjualung, suddenly
starting up, cried: “Where are they? Where are they?” When the Inuit
pointed them out he said: “What! those little things? Those are not
worth the bustle; they are small foxes, not bears,” and he crushed one
between his fingers, while he put the other into the eyelet of his boot
and strangled it there.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_bear" id = "tales_bear">THE BEAR STORY.</a></h4>

<p>This story is reprinted from Hall (II, p. 240):</p>

<div class = "quote">
<p>Many moons ago, a woman obtained a polar bear cub but two or three
days old. Having long desired just such a pet, she gave it her closest
attention, as though it were a son, nursing it, making for it a soft
warm bed alongside her own, and talking to it as a mother does to her
child. She had no living relative, and she and the bear occupied the
house alone. Kunikdjuaq, as he grew up, proved that the woman had not
taught him in vain, for he early began to hunt seals and salmon,
bringing them to his mother before eating any himself, and receiving his
share from her hands. She always watched from the hilltop for his
return, and if she saw that he had been unsuccessful, she begged from
her neighbors blubber for his food. She learned how this was from her
lookout, for if successful, he came back in the tracks made on going
out, but if unsuccessful always by a different route. Learning to excel
the Inuit in hunting, he excited their envy, and, after long years of
faithful service, his death was resolved upon. On hearing this, the old
woman, overwhelmed with grief, offered to give up her own life if they
would but spare him who had so long supported her. Her offer was sternly
refused. Upon this, when all his enemies
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page639" id =
"page639">639</a></span>
had retired to their houses, the woman had a long talk with her
son&mdash;now well grown in years&mdash;telling him that wicked men were
about to kill him, and that the only way to save his life and hers was
for him to go off and not return. At the same time she begged him not to
go so far that she could not wander off and meet him, and get from him a
seal or something else which she might need. The bear, after listening
to what she said with tears streaming down her furrowed cheeks, gently
placed one huge paw on her head, and then throwing both around her neck,
said, “Good mother, Kunikdjuaq will always be on the lookout for you and
serve you as best he can.” Saying this, he took her advice and departed,
almost as much to the grief of the children of the village as to the
mother.</p>

<p>Not long after this, being in need of food, she walked out on the sea
ice to see if she could not meet her son, and soon recognized him as one
of two bears who were lying down together. He ran to her, and she patted
him on the head in her old familiar way, told him her wants, and begged
him to hurry away and get something for her. Away ran the bear, and in a
few moments the woman looked upon a terrible fight going on between him
and his late companion, which, however, to her great relief, was soon
ended by her son’s dragging a lifeless body to her feet. With her knife
she quickly skinned the dead bear, giving her son large slices of the
blubber, and telling him that she would soon return for the meat, which
she could not at first carry to her house, and when her supply should
again fail she would comeback for his help. This she continued to do for
“a&nbsp;long, long time,” the faithful bear always serving her and
receiving the same unbroken love of his youth.</p>
</div>


<h4><a name = "tales_sundry" id = "tales_sundry">SUNDRY TALES.</a></h4>

<p>(1) Two little girls, while playing about a cliff near Aivillik, with
infants in the hoods on their backs, went into an opening between the
rocks, which closed upon them before escape was possible. All attempts
at rescue were unsuccessful, and the poor children, to whom for a time
meat and water were passed, perished in the cliffs (Hall II,
p.&nbsp;222).</p>

<p>(2) Opposite to Niutang, a village in Kingnait, Cumberland Sound,
there is a vein of diorite resembling a boot, and therefore called
Kamingujang. A&nbsp;long time ago two enemies lived in the village. One
day they stood on the beach ready to go hunting. Suddenly the one
exclaimed, pointing to Kamingujang, “There he blows,” making his enemy
believe that a whale was passing up the fjord and inducing him to look
out for it. Then he killed him from behind, piercing him with the
spear.</p>

<p>(3) At Qognung, near the head of Nettilling Fjord, there is a large
white stone on each side of the fjord, somewhat resembling a bear. It is
said that these stones have been bears which, being pursued by an Eskimo
in the water, escaped to the land, but were transformed into these
stones.</p>

<p>(4) A long time ago a dead boy was buried under a large stone. Before
his relatives had returned to their hut the body was transformed into a
hare, which jumped forth from the tomb. All hares come from this
animal.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page640" id =
"page640">640</a></span>
<p>(5) It is said that albinos of seals and deer spring from an egg of
about half a foot in length, which forms itself in the earth. The seal
digs an underground passage to the sea, the deer a similar one to a
distant part of the country, and there they rise. The albinos are said
to be very quick.</p>

<p class = "space">
I will add here an enumeration of the fabulous tribes of which I gained
intelligence, but of some of them I only know the names.</p>

<p>(1) The Tornit, or, as they are called by the Akudnirmiut, the
Tuniqdjuait (<a href = "#page634">p.&nbsp;634</a>). It is remarkable
that this people is considered here, as well as in Labrador,
a&nbsp;tribe similar to the Eskimo, with whom they formerly lived in
company, but who were subsequently expelled by the latter. In Greenland
they are entirely a fabulous tribe, each individual being of enormous
size, living inland and seldom hunting in the upper parts of the fjords.
While in the western parts of the Eskimo country a more historical form
of the tradition is preserved, it is entirely mythical in Greenland.</p>

<p>(2) The Adlet or Erqigdlit. In the tradition treating of this tribe a
similar change occurs. The Labrador Eskimo call the Indians of the
interior Adlet, the tribes west of Hudson Bay call them Erqigdlit. The
Baffin Land Eskimo and the Greenlanders have forgotten this relation
altogether, but denote with the term a fabulous tribe with dogs’ legs
and a human body. The name Adla is used as far north as Cumberland
Peninsula, the Akudnirmiut and the more northern tribes using the term
Erqigdlit. It is difficult to account for the use of these different
terms in both senses.</p>

<p>(3) The Ardnainiq, a tribe living in the extreme northwest. The men
of this people are small, tiny, like children, but entirely covered with
hair. They are carried about in the hoods of their wives, just like
children. The women are of normal size. They do all the work, going out
hunting in the kayaks and providing for the men.</p>

<p>(4) The Inuarudligang, dwarfs living in the cliffs near the
shore.</p>

<p>(5) The Igdlungajung, a bandy legged people living inland.</p>

<p>(6) The Uissuit, dwarfs living in the depth of the sea (<a href =
"#page621">p.&nbsp;621</a>).</p>

<p>(7) The Ijirang.</p>

<p>(8) The Qailerte´tang, a people consisting of women only (<a href =
"#page605">p.&nbsp;605</a>).</p>

<p class = "space">
Finally, I will mention the animals which are only known to the natives
by reports of foreign tribes and are described as fabulous creatures.
These are the umingmang (the musk&nbsp;ox), which is represented as a
fierce animal with black and red streaks and larger than a bear, and the
agdlaq (the black bear), which, according to their belief, is also of
enormous size. It is said to live inland and to devour everything that
comes near it. I&nbsp;am unable to decide whether the report of an
enormous fish, the idluk, which is said to live in the lakes, is
altogether fabulous. The natives say that if they want to catch the fish
they build a snow house on the lake and cut a hole through the ice, into
which they sink the hook with a deer’s ham for
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page641" id =
"page641">641</a></span>
a bait and a stout thong for a fishing line. Six men hold the line by
turns, and as soon as they feel the fish has nibbled they pull it up
with all their strength.</p>

<p>The fabulous amaroq and avignaq of the Greenlanders are unknown, but
the terms denote real animals, the wolf and the lemming.</p>

<p class = "space">
Besides traditions of this kind the Eskimo have a great number of
fables. Following is an example.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_sundry_owl" id = "tales_sundry_owl">THE OWL AND THE
RAVEN.</a></h4>

<p>The owl and the raven were fast friends. One day the raven made a new
dress, dappled white and black, for the owl, who in return made a pair
of boots of whalebone for the raven and then began to make a white
dress. But when he was about to try it on, the raven kept hopping about
and would not sit still. The owl got angry and said: “Now sit still or I
shall pour out the lamp over you.” As the raven continued hopping about,
the owl fell into a passion and poured the oil upon it. Then the raven
cried “Qaq! Qaq!” and since that day has been black all over.</p>


<h4><a name = "tales_compare" id = "tales_compare">COMPARISON BETWEEN
BAFFIN LAND TRADITIONS AND THOSE OF OTHER&nbsp;TRIBES.</a></h4>

<p>The similarity of the language and traditions of the Eskimo from
Behring Strait to Greenland is remarkable, considering the distance
which separates the tribes. Unfortunately the material from other
tribes, except the Greenlanders, is very scanty, but it is probable that
the same traditions or elements of traditions are known to all the
tribes. In the following table the above traditions are compared with
Rink’s Tales and Traditions of the Greenlanders and with those of other

<p>Some of these stories are almost identical in both countries, for
instance, Qaudjaqdjuq, the origin of the narwhal, &amp;c., and it is of
great interest to learn that some passages, particularly speeches and
songs, occur literally in both countries, for instance, the interesting
song of Niviarsiang (<a href = "#page637">page 637</a>) and the
conclusion of the Kiviung tradition. The tradition of the Tornit and the
form of the second tale (origin of the narwhal) resemble much more those
of Labrador than those of Greenland. The elements of which the
traditions are composed are combined differently in the tales of Baffin
Land and Greenland, but most of these elements are identical.

<p>The table shows that the following ideas are known to all tribes from
Alaska to Greenland: The sun myth, representing the sun as the brother
of the moon; the legend of the descent of man from a dog; the origin of
thunder by rubbing a deerskin; the origin of fish from chips of wood;
and the story of the origin of deer.</p>

<p>It must be regretted that very few traditions have as yet been
collected in Alaska, as the study of such material would best enable us
to decide upon the question of the origin of the Eskimo.</p>




<h3><a name = "arts" id = "arts">SCIENCE AND THE ARTS.</a></h3>


<h4><a name = "arts_geog" id = "arts_geog">GEOGRAPHY AND
NAVIGATION.</a></h4>

<p>The Eskimo exhibit a thorough knowledge of the geography of their
country. I&nbsp;have already treated of their migrations and mentioned
that the area they travel over is of considerable extent. They have a
very clear conception of all the countries they have seen or heard of,
knowing the distances by day’s journeys, or, as they say, by sleeps, and
the directions by the cardinal points. So far as I know, all these
tribes call true south piningnang, while the other points are called
according to the weather prevailing while the wind blows from the
different quarters. In Cumberland Sound uangnang is west-northwest;
qaningnang (that is, snow wind), east-northeast; nigirn, southeast; and
aqsardnirn, the fohn-like wind blowing from the fjords of the east
coast. On Nettilling these names are the same, the east-northeast only
being called qanara (that is, is it snow?) In Akudnirn uangnang is
west-southwest; ikirtsuq (i.e., the wind of the open sea),
east-northeast; oqurtsuq (i.e., the wind of the land Oqo or of the lee
side, southeast; and avangnanirn (i.e., from the north side along the
shore), the northwestern gales. According to Parry the same names as in
Cumberland Sound are used in Iglulik.</p>

<p>If the weather is clear the Eskimo use the positions of the sun, of
the dawn, or of the moon and stars for steering, and find their way
pretty well, as they know the direction of their point of destination
exactly. If the weather is thick they steer by the wind, or, if it is
calm, they do not travel at all. After a gale they feel their way by
observing the direction of the snowdrifts.</p>

<p>They distinguish quite a number of constellations, the most important
of which are Tuktuqdjung (the deer), our Ursa Major; the Pleiades,
Sakietaun; and the belt of Orion, Udleqdjun.</p>

<p>As their knowledge of all the directions is very detailed and they
are skillful draftsmen they can draw very good charts. If a man intends
to visit a country little known to him, he has a map drawn in the snow
by some one well acquainted there and these maps are so good that every
point can be recognized. Their way of drawing
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page644" id =
"page644">644</a></span>
is first to mark some points the relative positions of which are well
known. They like to stand on a hill and to look around in order to place
these correctly. This done, the details are inserted. It is remarkable
that their ideas of the relative position and direction of coasts far
distant one from another are so very clear. Copies of some charts drawn
by Eskimo of Cumberland Sound and Davis Strait are here introduced
(Plate IV, p.&nbsp;643, and Figs. 543&ndash;546). A&nbsp;comparison
between the maps and these charts will prove their correctness.
Frequently the draftsman makes his own country, with which he is best
acquainted, too large; if some principal points are marked first, he
will avoid this mistake. The distance between the extreme points
represented in the first chart (Fig. 543) is about five hundred
miles.</p>

<p>The Eskimo have a sort of calendar. They divide the year into
thirteen months, the names of which vary a great deal, according to the
tribes and according to the latitude of the place. The surplus is
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page648" id =
"page648">648</a></span>
balanced by leaving out a month every few years, to wit, the month
siringilang (without sun), which is of indefinite duration, the name
covering the whole time of the year when the sun does not rise and there
is scarcely any dawn. Thus every few years this month is totally
omitted, when the new moon and the winter solstice coincide. The name
qaumartenga is applied only to the days without sun but with dawn, while
the rest of the same moon is called siriniktenga. The days of the month
are very exactly designated by the age of the moon. Years are not
reckoned for a longer space than two, backward and forward.</p>

<h4><a name = "arts_music" id = "arts_music">POETRY AND MUSIC.</a></h4>

<p>Among the arts of the Eskimo poetry and music are by far the most
prominent. The tales which have been related are only a small part of
their stock of traditions. Besides the contents their form also is very
interesting, as most of them have been handed down in unchanged form and
their narration demands a great deal of art. Many traditions are told in
a very abridged form, the substance being supposed to be known.
A&nbsp;specimen of this kind is the Sedna tradition (<a href =
"#page604">p.&nbsp;604</a>). All these tales must be considered
recitatives, many of them beginning with a musical phrase and continuing
as a rhythmic recitation, others being recited in rhythmic phrases
throughout. Other traditions are told in a more detailed and prosaic
manner, songs or recitations, however, being sometimes included.
Ititaujang, for instance, in traveling into the country looking for his
wife, sings the song No. XIII, and in the Kalopaling tradition the boy,
on seeing the two Inuit coming, sings:</p>

</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page649" id =
"page649">649</a></span>
<p>Some Eskimo are very good narrators and understand how to express the
feelings of the different persons by modulations of the voice. In
addition, as a number of tales are really onomatopoetic, an artistic
effect is produced. The way of reciting is always similar to the one
above described by <a href = "#arts_music">notes</a> (p.&nbsp;648).</p>

<p>Besides these tales, which may be called poetic prose, there are real
poems of a very marked rhythm, which are not sung but recited. The
following are examples:</p>

<h5><a name = "song_merry" id = "song_merry">MERRYMAKING AMONG THE

<p class = "illustration">

left with their legs bent and their hands hanging down, the palms
touching each other. In crying aq! aq! they jump as high as
possible.</p>

</p>

<p>Besides these old songs and tales there are a great number of new
ones, and, indeed, almost every man has his own tune and his own song.
A&nbsp;few of these become great favorites among the Eskimo and are sung
like our popular songs. The summer song (<a href =
"#songI">No.&nbsp;I</a>) and “The returning hunter” (<a href =
"#songII">No.&nbsp;II</a>) may be most frequently heard. As to the
contents of the songs, they treat of almost everything imaginable: of
the beauty of summer; of thoughts and feelings of the composer on any
occasion, for instance, when watching a seal, when angry with somebody,
&amp;c.; or they tell of an important event, as of a long journey.
Satiric songs are great favorites.</p>

<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page650" id =
"page650">650</a></span>
<p>The form of both old and new songs is very strict, they being divided
into verses of different length, alternating regularly. I&nbsp;give here
some examples:</p>

<p>Some of these verses contain only a single word, the rhythm being
brought about by the chorus aja, amna aja, &amp;c. I&nbsp;add two
examples of this kind:</p>

<div class = "song">
<h5>V. Song in the language of the Angakut:</h5>

<p>Pissutaramaima tavunga tavunga tavungadlo tavunga, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The rhythm of the songs will best be understood by examining the
melodies. Every long syllable may be replaced by two or even three short
ones; other short syllables appear as unaccented parts before the
accented part of a measure; in short, the rhythmic adaptation of the
words to the melody is very arbitrary and interchanges frequently occur,
so that it is impossible to speak of metric feet. At the same time this
furnishes distinct proof that the musical rhythm is the decisive element
in determining the form. The rhythmic arrangement of the words is
regulated with considerable exactness by the quantity of the syllables,
and not by the accent. While, for instance, in speaking, it would be
“palirtu´gun,” in song No.&nbsp;IV it is “palir´tugun´,” and in
No.&nbsp;I “tekto´roti´kelek´tlune,” instead of “tektorotikelektlu´ne,”
&amp;c. Such displacements of the accent, however, are avoided if
possible, and in the best and most popular songs they hardly appear at
all.</p>

<p class = "mynote">
The numbers refer to the songs printed below, so “No. I” is the
Summer Song, No.&nbsp;II above. But the quoted word
“tektorotikelektlune”
occurs only in the first version.</p>

<p>The construction of the songs corresponds entirely with that of the
music, inasmuch as every melody and every rhythmically spoken song is
made up of musical, that is, rhythmic, phrases which are divided by
cæsuræ. Repetitions of the same phrases are very frequent.
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page652" id =
"page652">652</a></span>
The adaptation of the melodies to our divisions of time and measure is
also somewhat arbitrary, as they frequently consist of a mixture of
three and four part phrases. It is for this reason that I have noted
down some songs without any division into bars or measures and in those
cases have only marked the accented syllables.</p>

<p>Among the twenty melodies and rhythmic poems we find ten of binary
measures, five of triple measures, and six of mixed ones. Of the whole
number, nine begin on the full bar, eleven on the arsis.</p>

<p>The melodies move within the following range: In a fifth
(No.&nbsp;III), one; in a minor sixth (Nos. VII, IX,&nbsp;X), three; in
a major sixth (Nos. II, IV, XVII), three; in a seventh (Nos. XII, XIV),
two; in an octave, (Nos. I, II, V, VIII, XI, XVI), six; in a minor ninth
(No.&nbsp;VI), one; in a major ninth <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘No. (V)’">(No.&nbsp;V)</ins>, one; in a tenth
(No.&nbsp;XIII), one.</p>

<p>These may be divided into two very characteristic and distinct
groups. The first, which would coincide with our major key, contains the
following essential tones:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/music5.png" width = "223" height = "55" alt = "music notation: c d e g a"></p>

<p class = "musiclink">
<script type = "text/javascript">
writeMusic("central652a","Music","<br><i>or<\/i>");
</script>

<a href = "music/central652a.midi" target = "_blank">Music</a>
</p>

<p>The fourth and the sixth occur seldom, and then only as subordinate
tones. This key is identical with the Chinese and many of the Indian
ones.</p>

<p>In the second group, which corresponds to our minor key, we
frequently find the fourth, while the sixth only appears twice and then
as a subordinate tone (in&nbsp;No.&nbsp;XV). We furthermore find the
major seventh in the lower position leading back to the beginning, i.e.,
the key note. The essential components of this key are:</p>

<a href = "music/central652b.midi" target = "_blank">Music</a>
</p>

<p>Professor R. Succo calls attention to the fact that the relation of
the melodies to their key note resembles that of the Gregorian chants,
especially the psalmodic ones among them.</p>

<p>If we, in accordance with our ideas, suppose the melody&mdash;No.
XIII, for example&mdash;to begin in C major, it nevertheless does not
conclude in the same key, but in&nbsp;E. We would say that No. XIV is
written in A minor; still it ends in&nbsp;E. We find the same in the
Gregorian chants. They also resemble the songs of the Eskimo in the
retention of the same note during a large number of consecutive
syllables.</p>

<p>On the whole the melodies, even to our musical sense, can be traced
to a key note. However, changes often occur as well (see No.&nbsp;VI).
A&nbsp;very striking construction appears in No. XIII, where the
oft-repeated E forms a new key note, while at the conclusion the melody
leaps back without any modulation to C through the peculiar interval,
ḇ,&nbsp;c.</p>

station was established in Nugumiut two years ago, and the Scottish
steamers which used to fish in Baffin Bay and the northern parts of
Davis Strait are beginning to visit Cumberland Sound and Hudson Strait.
The whaling in Baffin Bay shows a sudden falling off and it seems that
the number of ships will be greatly reduced. This cannot be without
influence upon the Eskimo, who will probably begin again to flock to
Cumberland Sound and Nugumiut.</p>

<p><a href = "#page538">Page 538</a>. In 1884 and 1885 a lively
intercourse existed between Padli and Cumberland Sound, and in the
spring of the latter year the dog’s disease broke out for the first time
on the coast of Davis Strait, and spread, so far as is known, to the
northern part of Home Bay.</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "app3" id = "app3">Note 3.</a></h4>

<p><a href = "#page574">Page 574</a>. A peculiar game is sometimes
played on the ice in spring. The men stand in a circle on the ice, and
one of them walks, the toes turned inward, in a devious track. It is
said that only a few are able to do this in the right way. Then the rest
of the men have to follow him in exactly the same track.</p>

<p>One of their gymnastic exercises requires considerable knack and
strength. A&nbsp;pole is tied with one end to a stone or to a piece of
wood that is firmly secured in the snow. A&nbsp;man then lies down on
his back, embracing the pole, his feet turned toward the place where the
pole is tied to the rock. Then he must rise without bending his
body.</p>

<p>In another of their gymnastic exercises they lie down on their
stomachs, the arms bent so that the hands lie close together on the
breast, palms turned downward. Then they have to jump forward without
bending their body, using only their toes and hands. Some are said to be
able to jump several feet in this manner.</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "app4" id = "app4">Note 4.</a></h4>

<p><a href = "#page582">Page 582</a>. In the Report of the Hudson Bay
Expedition of 1886, p.&nbsp;16, Lieut. A.&nbsp;Gordon remarks that the
same custom is reported from Port Burwell, near Cape Chidleigh,
Labrador. He says: “There lived between the Cape and Aulatsivik a good
Eskimo hunter whose native name is not given, but who was christened by
our station men ’Old Wicked.’ He was a passionate man and was
continually
<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page668" id =
"page668">668</a></span>
threatening to do some bodily harm to the other more peaceably inclined
natives. &nbsp;<span class = "emspace">***</span>His arrogance and petty
annoyances to the other natives became at length unbearable. It appears
that these unfortunates held a meeting and decided that Old Wicked was a
public nuisance which must be abated, and they therefore decreed that he
should be shot, and shot he was accordingly one afternoon when he was
busily engaged in repairing the ravages which a storm had made in his
‘igdlu’ or snow house. The executioner shot him in the back, killing him
instantly. The murderer or executioner (one hardly knows to which title
he is more justly entitled) then takes Old Wicked’s wives and all his
children and agrees to keep them &nbsp;<span class =
"emspace">***</span>so that they shall be no burden on the company.”</p>

<p>The fact that the custom is found among tribes so widely separated
will justify a description of those events which came under my own
observation. There was a native of Padli by the name of Padlu. He had
induced the wife of a Cumberland Sound native to desert her husband and
follow him. The deserted husband, meditating revenge, cut off the upper
part of the barrel of his gun so that he could conceal it under his
jacket. He crossed the land and visited his friends in Padli, but before
he could accomplish his intention of killing Padlu the latter shot him.
When this news was reported in Qeqerten, the brother of the murdered man
went to Padli to avenge the death of his brother; but he also was killed
by Padlu. A&nbsp;third native of Cumberland Sound, who wished to avenge
the death of his relatives, was also murdered by him. On account of all
these outrages the natives wanted to get rid of Padlu, but yet they did
not dare to attack him. When the pimain of the Akudnirmiut in
Niaqonaujang learned of these events he started southward and asked
every man in Padli whether Padlu should be killed. All agreed; so he
went with the latter deer hunting in the upper part of Pangnirtung,
northwest of Padli, and near the head of the fjord he shot Padlu in the
back.</p>

<p>In another instance a man in Qeqerten had made himself odious. After
it was agreed that he was a bad man an old man of Qeqerten, Pakaq,
attacked him on board a Scottish whaler, but was prevented from killing
him.</p>


<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "app5" id = "app5">Note 5.</a></h4>

<p><a href = "#page594">Page 594</a>. The following performance was
observed in Umanaqtuaq, on the southwestern coast of Cumberland Sound,
in the winter of 1886-’87: An angakoq began his incantations in a hut
after the lamps were lowered. Suddenly he jumped up and rushed out of
the hut to where a mounted harpoon was standing. He threw himself upon
the harpoon, which penetrated his breast and came out at the back. Three
men followed him and holding the harpoon line led the angakoq, bleeding
profusely, to all the huts of the village. When they arrived again at
the first hut he pulled out the harpoon, lay down on the bed, and was
put to sleep by the songs of another angakoq. When he awoke after a
while he showed to the people that he was not hurt, although his
clothing was torn and they had seen him bleeding.</p>

<p>Another angakoq performed a similar feat on the island Utussivik in
the summer of 1887. He thrust a harpoon through his body and was led by
about twenty-five men through the village. It is said that he imitated
the movements and voice of a walrus while on the circuit.</p>

<p>Still another exhibition was witnessed by the whalers in the fall of
1886 in Umanaqtuaq. An angakoq stripped off his outer jacket and began
his incantations while walking about in the village. When the men heard
him, one after the other came out of his hut, each carrying his gun.
After a while the angakoq descended to the beach; the men followed him,
and suddenly fired a volley at him. The angakoq, of course, was not
hurt, and then the women each gave him a cup of water, which he drank.
Then he put on his jacket, and the performance was ended. The similarity
of this performance with part of the festival which is described on
<a href = "#page605">pp.&nbsp;605 et seq.</a> is evident.</p>


<span class = "pagenum"><a name = "page669" id =

<h4 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "app6" id = "app6">Note 6.</a></h4>

<p><a href = "#page606">Page 606</a>. The same feast was celebrated in
1886 in Umanaqtuaq, in Cumberland Sound, where all the Talirpingmiut had
gathered. The witnesses of this festival describe it exactly in the same
way as I described it above. One thing ought to be added, which I did
not mention because it seemed to me accidental, but as it was repeated
in the same way in 1886 it must have some meaning. I&nbsp;noticed that
the Qailertetang, after having invoked the wind, hop about, making a
grunting noise and accosting the people. When doing so they are attacked
by the natives and killed. According to the description of the whalers
they imitate sometimes deer, sometimes walrus. Perhaps this fact gave
rise to Kumlien’s description of the “killing of the evil spirit of the
deer.” It is remarkable that in 1883 in Qeqerten and in 1886 in
Umanaqtuaq the festival was celebrated on exactly the same day, the 10th
of November. This can hardly be accidental, and does not agree with the
idea sometimes advanced, that the festival refers to the winter
solstice. Unfortunately Hall (I,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;528) does not give the
dates of the festival in Nugumiut. On the western coast of Hudson Bay a
festival in which masks were used was celebrated about the end of
January, 1866 (Hall II, p.&nbsp;219), but it is hardly possible to draw
conclusions from Nourse’s superficial account of Hall’s
observations.</p>

<p><a href = "#page615">Page 615</a>. It may be of interest to learn
that in 1885 and 1886 two instances of this kind occurred in Cumberland
Sound. There was a very old woman in Qeqerten by the name of
Qaχodloaping. She was well provided for by her relatives, but it seems
that one of the most influential men in Qeqerten, Pakaq, whom I
mentioned above (<a href = "#page668">p.&nbsp;668</a>) as the
executioner of a murderer, deemed it right that she should die. So,
although she resisted him, he took her out of her hut one day to a hill
and buried her alive under stones. Another case was that of an old woman
whose health had been failing for a number of years. She lived with her
son, whose wife died late in the autumn of 1886. According to the
religious ideas of the Eskimo, the young man had to throw away his
clothing. When, later on, his mother felt as though she could not live
through the winter, she insisted upon being killed, as she did not want
to compel her son to cast away a second set of clothing. At last her son
complied with her request. She stripped off her outside jacket and
breeches, and was conveyed on a sledge to a near island, where she was
left alone to die from cold and hunger. The son who took her there did
not use his own sledge nor any other Eskimo sledge for this purpose, but
borrowed that of the Scottish whaling station.</p>

From a rather ambiguous statement (p. 355) it would seem that Owutta

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
